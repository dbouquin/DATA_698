0,"Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.",Generalized Gradient Approximation Made Simple
1,"From a theory of Hohenberg and Kohn, approximation methods for treating an inhomogeneous system of interacting electrons are developed. These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 23.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods. An appendix deals with a further correction for systems with short-wavelength density oscillations.",Self-Consistent Equations Including Exchange and Correlation Effects
2,"We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>atoms</SUB> operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>atoms</SUB> scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach N<SUB>atoms</SUB>. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.",Efficient iterative schemes for ab initio total-energy calculations using a plane-wave basis set
3,"This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n<SUB>0</SUB>+n~(r), n~n<SUB>0</SUB>〈〈1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr<SUB>0</SUB>) with ϕ arbitrary and r<SUB>0</SUB>--〉∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.",Inhomogeneous Electron Gas
4,"A correlation-energy formula due to Colle and Salvetti [Theor. Chim. Acta 37, 329 (1975)], in which the correlation energy density is expressed in terms of the electron density and a Laplacian of the second-order Hartree-Fock density matrix, is restated as a formula involving the density and local kinetic-energy density. On insertion of gradient expansions for the local kinetic-energy density, density-functional formulas for the correlation energy and correlation potential are then obtained. Through numerical calculations on a number of atoms, positive ions, and molecules, of both open- and closed-shell type, it is demonstrated that these formulas, like the original Colle-Salvetti formulas, give correlation energies within a few percent.",Development of the Colle-Salvetti correlation-energy formula into a functional of the electron density
5,"Despite the remarkable thermochemical accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional theories with gradient corrections for exchange-correlation [see, for example, A. D. Becke, J. Chem. Phys. 96, 2155 (1992)], we believe that further improvements are unlikely unless exact-exchange information is considered. Arguments to support this view are presented, and a semiempirical exchange-correlation functional containing local-spin-density, gradient, and exact-exchange terms is tested on 56 atomization energies, 42 ionization potentials, 8 proton affinities, and 10 total atomic energies of first- and second-row systems. This functional performs significantly better than previous functionals with gradient corrections only, and fits experimental atomization energies with an impressively small average absolute deviation of 2.4 kcal/mol.",Density-functional thermochemistry.

6,A method is given for generating sets of special points in the Brillouin zone which provides an efficient means of integrating periodic functions of the wave vector. The integration can be over the entire Brillouin zone or over specified portions thereof. This method also has applications in spectral and density-of-state calculations. The relationships to the Chadi-Cohen and Gilat-Raubenheimer methods are indicated.,Special points for Brillouin-zone integrations
7,"An approach for electronic structure calculations is described that generalizes both the pseudopotential method and the linear augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method in a natural way. The method allows high-quality first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations to be performed using the original fictitious Lagrangian approach of Car and Parrinello. Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation.",Projector augmented-wave method
8,"The formal relationship between ultrasoft (US) Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials and Blรถchl's projector augmented wave (PAW) method is derived. It is shown that the total energy functional for US pseudopotentials can be obtained by linearization of two terms in a slightly modified PAW total energy functional. The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H<SUB>2</SUB>, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, Li<SUB>2</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>, F<SUB>2</SUB>, BF<SUB>3</SUB>, SiF<SUB>4</SUB>) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF<SUB>2</SUB>, Fe, Co, Ni). Particular attention is paid to the bulk properties and magnetic energies of Fe, Co, and Ni.",From ultrasoft pseudopotentials to the projector augmented-wave method
9,"We describe monocrystalline graphitic films, which are a few atoms thick but are nonetheless stable under ambient conditions, metallic, and of remarkably high quality. The films are found to be a two-dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands, and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 10<SUP>13</SUP> per square centimeter and with room-temperature mobilities of ~10,000 square centimeters per volt-second can be induced by applying gate voltage.",Electric Field Effect in Atomically Thin Carbon Films

11,"We present a full-sky 100 μm map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H<SUB>2</SUB> in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> at 240 μm (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg<SUB>2</SUB> index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.",Maps of Dust Infrared Emission for Use in Estimation of Reddening and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Foregrounds
12,"We report measurements of the mass density, Ω<SUB>M</SUB>, and cosmological-constant energy density, Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Ω<SUB>M</SUB>-0.6Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>~-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest (Ω<SUB>M</SUB>〈~1.5). For a flat (Ω<SUB>M</SUB>+Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>=1) cosmology we find Ω<SUP>flat</SUP><SUB>M</SUB>=0.28<SUP>+0.09</SUP><SUB>-0.08</SUB> (1 σ statistical) <SUP>+0.05</SUP><SUB>-0.04</SUB> (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Λ=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ〉0)=99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t<SUP>flat</SUP><SUB>0</SUB>=14.9<SUP>+1.4</SUP><SUB>-1.1</SUB>(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.",Measurements of Ω and Λ from 42 High-Redshift Supernovae
13,"We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 〈= z 〈= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda 〉 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 〈 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M 〉= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 〈 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda 〉 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda 〉 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda 〉 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 〉= 0.",Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant

15,"In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlรถf, Taylor, and co-workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree-Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen-containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlรถf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94%-97% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.",Gaussian basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations. I.

16,"We present ab initio quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations based on the calculation of the electronic ground state and of the Hellmann-Feynman forces in the local-density approximation at each molecular-dynamics step. This is possible using conjugate-gradient techniques for energy minimization, and predicting the wave functions for new ionic positions using subspace alignment. This approach avoids the instabilities inherent in quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics calculations for metals based on the use of a fictitious Newtonian dynamics for the electronic degrees of freedom. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity and allows us to perform simulations over several picoseconds.",Ab initio molecular dynamics for liquid metals

19,"The preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needlelike tubes is reported. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene sythesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets ranging in number from two up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometers in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.",Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon
20,"WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Λ-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, Ω<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>=0.024+/-0.001, Ω<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>=0.14+/-0.02, τ=0.166<SUP>+0.076</SUP><SUB>-0.071</SUB>, n<SUB>s</SUB>=0.99+/-0.04, and σ<SUB>8</SUB>=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyα forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Lyα forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71<SUP>+0.04</SUP><SUB>-0.03</SUB>, Ω<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>=0.0224+/-0.0009, Ω<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>=0.135<SUP>+0.008</SUP><SUB>-0.009</SUB>, τ=0.17+/-0.06, n<SUB>s</SUB>(0.05 Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>)=0.93+/-0.03, and σ<SUB>8</SUB>=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of τ=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Lyα forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Lyα forest. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Ω<SUB>tot</SUB>=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w〈-0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming w〉=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: Ω<SUB>ν</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>〈0.0072 (95% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.

21,"A new approach to the construction of first-principles pseudopotentials is described. The method allows transferability to be improved systematically while holding the cutoff radius fixed, even for large cutoff radii. Novel features are that the pseudopotential itself becomes charge-state dependent, the usual norm-conservation constraint does not apply, and a generalized eigenproblem is introduced. The potentials have a separable form well suited for plane-wave solid-state calculations, and show promise for application to first-row and transition-metal systems.",Soft self-consistent pseudopotentials in a generalized eigenvalue formalism

The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons.

23,"Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large $N$ limits of certain conformal field theories in $d$ dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of $d+1$-dimensional $AdS$ space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times {\bf S}^5$ match with the chiral operators of $\N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the $\N=4$ theory has a large $N$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of $AdS$ black holes.",Anti-de Sitter space and holography

25,"We show that the large N limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large N. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d N =4 super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.",The Large N Limit of Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity
26,"Summary. The outward transfer of the angular momentum of the accreting matter leads to the formation of a disk around the black hole. The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M ă 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbed by the low temperature outer regions. saturated by broad recombination and resonance emission lines. Variability, connected with the character of the motion of the black hole, with gas flows in a binary system and with eclipses, is possible. Under certain conditions, the hard radiation can evaporate the gas. This can counteract the matter inflow into the disk and lead to autoregulation of the accretion. If M 3. 10-8M0 the luminosity of the disk around year the black hole is stabilized at the critical level of L 1038 M erg A small fraction of the accreting M0 s matter falls under the gravitational radius whereas the major part of it flows out with high velocity from the central regions of the disk. The outfiowing matter is opaque to the disk radiation and completely transforms its spectrum. In consequence, at the supercritical regime of accretion the black hole may appear as a bright, hot, optical star with a strong outflow of matter Key words: black holes - binary systems - X-ray sources - accretion The optical radiation spectrum of such objects must be",Black holes in binary systems.

27,"Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.",The rise of graphene

Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ""quick look"" CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ""C"" variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems.The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data.NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.",The NCEP/NCAR 40-Year Reanalysis Project.

We found that these pseudopotentials are extremely efficient for the cases where the plane-wave expansion has a slow convergence, in particular, for systems containing first-row elements, transition metals, and rare-earth elements.

33,"Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrรถdinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective `speed of light' c<SUB>*</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>6</SUP>ms<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions.

35,"Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3-4 % is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.","Atoms, molecules, solids, and surfaces: Applications of the generalized gradient approximation for exchange and correlation"

Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities.

37,"The parameterized extinction data of Fitzpatrick and Massa (1986, 1988) for the ultraviolet and various sources for the optical and near-infrared are used to derive a meaningful average extinction law over the 3.5 micron to 0.125 wavelength range which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium. The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.","The Relationship between Infrared, Optical, and Ultraviolet Extinction"
38,"We suggest a means of obtaining certain Green's functions in 3+1-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a large number of colors via non-critical string theory. The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2(ng<SUB>YM</SUB>sqrt(2N))<SUP>1/2</SUP> for large `t Hooft coupling.

Using WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model are (Ω<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>,Ω<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP>,h,n<SUB>s</SUB>,τ,σ<SUB>8</SUB>)=(0.1277<SUP>+0.0080</SUP><SUB>-0.0079</SUB>,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732<SUP>+0.031</SUP><SUB>-0.032</SUB>,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761<SUP>+0.049</SUP><SUB>-0.048</SUB>). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (n<SUB>s</SUB>=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r<SUB>0.002</SUB>〈0.65 (95% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r<SUB>0.002</SUB>〈0.30 (95% CL).

43,"Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator.

Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.",Colloquium: Topological insulators
44,"The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB>) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m <SUB>ν</SUB> 〈 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N <SUB>eff</SUB> = 4.34<SUP>+0.86</SUP> <SUB>-0.88</SUB> (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H <SUB>0</SUB>. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H <SUB>0</SUB>, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 ± 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Y<SUB>p</SUB> = 0.326 ± 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Δ α =-1.1± 1.4° statistical ± 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from ""universal profile"" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.

45,"The optical constants n and k were obtained for the noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) from reflection and transmission measurements on vacuum-evaporated thin films at room temperature, in the spectral range 0.5-6.5 eV.

The estimated error in d was +/- 2 Ă, and that in n, k was less than 0.02 over most of the spectral range. The results in the film-thickness range 250-500 Ă were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. The free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. The interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution.

47,"In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.",Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?
48,"A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏω. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏω)<SUP>2</SUP>, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kT<SUB>c</SUB> at T=0°K to zero at T<SUB>c</SUB>.

It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.",Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Lattices
50,"In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature{hkappa }/{2π k} ≈ 10^{ - 6} left( {{M_ odot }/M} right){}^ circ K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 10<SUP>15</SUP> g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.",Particle creation by black holes
51,"We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.",A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering

56,"Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays,, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

63,"The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought 'resonating-valence-bond' state or 'quantum spin liquid' hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.",The resonating valence bond state in La2CuO4 and superconductivity

65,"The evolutionary significance of the observed luminosity function for main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood is discussed. The hypothesis is made that stars move off the main sequence after burning about 10 per cent of their hydrogen mass and that stars have been created at a uniform rate in the solar neighborhood for the last five billion years. Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated. The total number and mass of stars which have moved off the main sequence is found to be comparable with the total number of white dwarfs and with the total mass of all fainter main-sequence stars, respectively.",The Luminosity Function and Stellar Evolution.
66,"Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.",Statistical mechanics of complex networks
67,"This review describes a new paradigm of electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron. Either adding the spin degree of freedom to conventional charge-based electronic devices or using the spin alone has the potential advantages of nonvolatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electric power consumption, and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices. To successfully incorporate spins into existing semiconductor technology, one has to resolve technical issues such as efficient injection, transport, control and manipulation, and detection of spin polarization as well as spin-polarized currents. Recent advances in new materials engineering hold the promise of realizing spintronic devices in the near future. We review the current state of the spin-based devices, efforts in new materials fabrication, issues in spin transport, and optical spin manipulation.",Spintronics: A Spin-Based Electronics Vision for the Future
68,"We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> and 2 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr at a resolution of 3 Å across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 Å for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.",Stellar population synthesis at the resolution of 2003
69,"Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √{ s} = 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb<SUP>-1</SUP> at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb<SUP>-1</SUP> at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W<SUP>+</SUP>W<SUP>-</SUP>, τ<SUP>+</SUP>τ<SUP>-</SUP>, and bbbar. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 (stat.) ± 0.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC
70,"When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction-a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.",Experimental observation of the quantum Hall effect and Berry's phase in graphene

72,"Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.",Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks

74,"Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficientlyâthose with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.",Fast Parallel Algorithms for Short-Range Molecular Dynamics

76,"This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ<SUB>∗</SUB> = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP>, Ω<SUB>b</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ω<SUB>c</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB> = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H<SUB>0</SUB> and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r<SUB>0.002</SUB>〈 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13<SUB>-0.10</SUB><SUP>+0.13</SUP>. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ ℓ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an ""anomaly"" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.",Planck 2013 results.

79,"Spintronics, or spin electronics, involves the study of active control and manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid-state systems. This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.",Spintronics: Fundamentals and applications
80,"Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25 Â°C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal-Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen-oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.",Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water

Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.",Galactic dynamics
82,"We propose a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem which does not rely on either supersymmetry or technicolor. In this framework, the gravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we take as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed weakness of gravity on distances 〉~ 1 mm is due to the existence of n〉=2 new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The Planck scale M<SUB>Pl</SUB>~G<SUB>N</SUB><SUP>-1/2</SUP> is not a fundamental scale; its enormity is simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While gravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the Standard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of weak scale ``thickness'' in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number of striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of n=2 new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may observe the transition from 1/r<SUP>2</SUP>--〉1/r<SUP>4</SUP> Newtonian gravitation. For any number of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum gravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4 dimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading to an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum p<SUB>T</SUB>〉~ TeV. For certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra dimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our four dimensional vacuum with frequencies of ~10<SUP>12</SUP> Hz or larger.

84,"A large data set consisting of about 1000 normal mode periods, 500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values, mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 Ă 10 <SUP>6</SUP> travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle.

The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints.

90,"A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian hat{H}(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp {iγ(C)} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of hat{H}(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of hat{H}, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed.

96,"We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ""universal"" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r<SUP>-2</SUP> near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.",The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos

This procedure involves the use of the recently proposed correlation-consistent basis sets augmented with functions to describe the more diffuse character of the atomic anion coupled with a straightforward, uniform expansion of the reference space for multireference singles and doubles configuration-interaction (MRSD-CI) calculations. Comparison with previous results and with corresponding full CI calculations are given. The most accurate EAs obtained from the MRSD-CI calculations are (with experimental values in parentheses) hydrogen 0.740 eV (0.754), boron 0.258 (0.277), carbon 1.245 (1.263), oxygen 1.384 (1.461), and fluorine 3.337 (3.401).

101,"A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation.",Statistical-Mechanical Theory of Irreversible Processes. I
102,"We present ab initio quantum-mechanical molecular-dynamics simulations of the liquid-metal-amorphous-semiconductor transition in Ge. Our simulations are based on (a) finite-temperature density-functional theory of the one-electron states, (b) exact energy minimization and hence calculation of the exact Hellmann-Feynman forces after each molecular-dynamics step using preconditioned conjugate-gradient techniques, (c) accurate nonlocal pseudopotentials, and (d) NosĂŠ dynamics for generating a canonical ensemble. This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity of the electron-ion ensemble and allows us to perform simulations over more than 30 ps. The computer-generated ensemble describes the structural, dynamic, and electronic properties of liquid and amorphous Ge in very good agreement with experiment. The simulation allows us to study in detail the changes in the structure-property relationship through the metal-semiconductor transition.

110,"A critical review is given of the current status of cosmological nucleosynthesis. In the framework of the standard model with 3 types of relativistic neutrinos, the baryon-to-photon ratio, \eta, corresponding to the inferred primordial abundances of helium-4 and lithium-7 is presently ~2 \sigma below the value implied by the abundance of deuterium. The latter value is also coincident with the independent determination of \eta from WMAP observations of CMB anisotropy. However taking systematic uncertainties in the abundance estimates into account, there is overall concordance in the range \eta = (3.4 - 6.9) x 10^{-10} @ 95% c.l. corresponding to a cosmological baryon density \Omega_B h^2 = 0.012 - 0.025.

111,"This paper is based on the elementary remark that the extraction of gauge invariant results from a formally gauge invariant theory is ensured if one employs methods of solution that involve only gauge covariant quantities. We illustrate this statement in connection with the problem of vacuum polarization by a prescribed electromagnetic field. The vacuum current of a charged Dirac field, which can be expressed in terms of the Green's function of that field, implies an addition to the action integral of the electromagnetic field. Now these quantities can be related to the dynamical properties of a ""particle"" with space-time coordinates that depend upon a proper-time parameter. The proper-time equations of motion involve only electromagnetic field strengths, and provide a suitable gauge invariant basis for treating problems. Rigorous solutions of the equations of motion can be obtained for a constant field, and for a plane wave field. A renormalization of field strength and charge, applied to the modified lagrange function for constant fields, yields a finite, gauge invariant result which implies nonlinear properties for the electromagnetic field in the vacuum. The contribution of a zero spin charged field is also stated. After the same field strength renormalization, the modified physical quantities describing a plane wave in the vacuum reduce to just those of the maxwell field; there are no nonlinear phenomena for a single plane wave, of arbitrary strength and spectral composition. The results obtained for constant (that is, slowly varying fields), are then applied to treat the two-photon disintegration of a spin zero neutral meson arising from the polarization of the proton vacuum. We obtain approximate, gauge invariant expressions for the effective interaction between the meson and the electromagnetic field, in which the nuclear coupling may be scalar, pseudoscalar, or pseudovector in nature. The direct verification of equivalence between the pseudoscalar and pseudovector interactions only requires a proper statement of the limiting processes involved. For arbitrarily varying fields, perturbation methods can be applied to the equations of motion, as discussed in Appendix A, or one can employ an expansion in powers of the potential vector. The latter automatically yields gauge invariant results, provided only that the proper-time integration is reserved to the last. This indicates that the significant aspect of the proper-time method is its isolation of divergences in integrals with respect to the proper-time parameter, which is independent of the coordinate system and of the gauge. The connection between the proper-time method and the technique of ""invariant regularization"" is discussed. Incidentally, the probability of actual pair creation is obtained from the imaginary part of the electromagnetic field action integral. Finally, as an application of the Green's function for a constant field, we construct the mass operator of an electron in a weak, homogeneous external field, and derive the additional spin magnetic moment of Îą2Ď magnetons by means of a perturbation calculation in which proper-mass plays the customary role of energy.",On Gauge Invariance and Vacuum Polarization

121,"With the high-temperature superconductors a qualitatively new regime in the phenomenology of type-II superconductivity can be accessed. The key elements governing the statistical mechanics and the dynamics of the vortex system are (dynamic) thermal and quantum fluctuations and (static) quenched disorder. The importance of these three sources of disorder can be quantified by the Ginzburg number Gi=(T<SUB>c</SUB>H<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>c</SUB>∊ξ<SUP>3</SUP>)<SUP>2</SUP>2, the quantum resistance Qu=(e<SUP>2</SUP>ℏ)(ρ<SUB>n</SUB>∊ξ), and the critical current-density ratio j<SUB>c</SUB>j<SUB>o</SUB>, with j<SUB>c</SUB> and j<SUB>o</SUB> denoting the depinning and depairing current densities, respectively (ρ<SUB>n</SUB> is the normal-state resistivity and ∊<SUP>2</SUP>=mM〈1 denotes the anisotropy parameter). The material parameters of the oxides conspire to produce a large Ginzburg number Gi~10<SUP>-2</SUP> and a large quantum resistance Qu~10<SUP>-1</SUP>, values which are by orders of magnitude larger than in conventional superconductors, leading to interesting effects such as the melting of the vortex lattice, the creation of new vortex-liquid phases, and the appearance of macroscopic quantum phenomena. Introducing quenched disorder into the system turns the Abrikosov lattice into a vortex glass, whereas the vortex liquid remains a liquid. The terms ""glass"" and ""liquid"" are defined in a dynamic sense, with a sublinear response ρ=∂E∂j|<SUB>j--〉0</SUB> characterizing the truly superconducting vortex glass and a finite resistivity ρ(j--〉0)〉0 being the signature of the liquid phase. The smallness of j<SUB>c</SUB>j<SUB>o</SUB> allows one to discuss the influence of quenched disorder in terms of the weak collective pinning theory. Supplementing the traditional theory of weak collective pinning to take into account thermal and quantum fluctuations, as well as the new scaling concepts for elastic media subject to a random potential, this modern version of the weak collective pinning theory consistently accounts for a large number of novel phenomena, such as the broad resistive transition, thermally assisted flux flow, giant and quantum creep, and the glassiness of the solid state. The strong layering of the oxides introduces additional new features into the thermodynamic phase diagram, such as a layer decoupling transition, and modifies the mechanism of pinning and creep in various ways. The presence of strong (correlated) disorder in the form of twin boundaries or columnar defects not only is technologically relevant but also provides the framework for the physical realization of novel thermodynamic phases such as the Bose glass. On a macroscopic scale the vortex system exhibits self-organized criticality, with both the spatial and the temporal scale accessible to experimental investigations.",Vortices in high-temperature superconductors
122,"Two approximate methods for solving the band-structure problem in an efficient and physically transparent way are presented and discussed in detail. The variational principle for the one-electron Hamiltonian is used in both schemes, and the trial functions are linear combinations of energy-independent augmented plane waves (APW) and muffin-tin orbitals (MTO), respectively. The secular equations are therefore eigenvalue equations, linear in energy. The trial functions are defined with respect to a muffin-tin (MT) potential and the energy bands depend on the potential in the spheres through potential parameters which describe the energy dependence of the logarithmic derivatives. Inside the spheres, the energy-independent APW is that linear combination of an exact solution, at the arbitrary but fixed energy E<SUB>Î˝</SUB>, and its energy derivative which matches continuously and differentiably onto the plane-wave part in the interstitial region. The energies obtained with the linear-APW method for the MT potential have errors of order (E-E<SUB>v</SUB>)<SUP>4</SUP>. Similarly, the energy-independent MTO is that linear combination which matches onto that solution of the Laplace equation in the interstitial region which is regular at infinity. The energies obtained with the linear-MTO method have additional errors of order (E-V<SUB>mtz</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP>, arising from the interstitial region where the potential is V<SUB>mtz</SUB>. The linear-APW (LAPW) method combines desirable features of the APW and OPW methods; it can treat d bands, the energy dependence of its pseudopotential is linear and, owing to the smoothness of the energy-independent APW at the spheres, non-MT contributions to the potential are included principally through their Fourier components. The linear-MTO (LMTO) method is particularly suited for closely packed structures and it combines desirable features of Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker, linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals, and cellular methods; the secular matrix is linear in energy, the overlap integrals factorize as potential parameters and structure constants, the latter are canonical in the sense that they neither depend on the energy nor the cell volume and they specify the boundary conditions on a single MT or atomic sphere in the most convenient way. This method is very well suited for self-consistent calculations. The empty-lattice test is applied to the linear-MTO method and the free-electron energy bands are accurately reproduced. Finally, it is shown how relativistic effects may be included in both the LAPW and LMTO methods.",Linear methods in band theory

125,"A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q<SUB>0</SUB> and frequency ω<SUB>0</SUB> of the instability. Type I<SUB>s</SUB> systems (ω<SUB>0</SUB>=0, q<SUB>0</SUB>≠0) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type III<SUB>o</SUB> systems (ω<SUB>0</SUB>≠0, q<SUB>0</SUB>=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type I<SUB>o</SUB> systems (ω<SUB>0</SUB>≠0, q<SUB>0</SUB>≠0) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via ""amplitude equations,"" whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the ""phase equation"" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing ""real pattern effects"" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying ""temporal chaos,"" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

Recent progress in the use of statistical measures of the clustering is described; and techniques for dealing with cosmic evolution, in the statistical measures of clustering and under general relativity theory, are considered.

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.",Electron Correlations in Narrow Energy Bands

We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system.

135,We propose an implementation of a universal set of one- and two-quantum-bit gates for quantum computation using the spin states of coupled single-electron quantum dots. Desired operations are effected by the gating of the tunneling barrier between neighboring dots. Several measures of the gate quality are computed within a recently derived spin master equation incorporating decoherence caused by a prototypical magnetic environment. Dot-array experiments that would provide an initial demonstration of the desired nonequilibrium spin dynamics are proposed.,Quantum computation with quantum dots
136,"We present full-sky microwave maps in five frequency bands (23-94 GHz) from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year sky survey. Calibration errors are less than 0.5%, and the low systematic error level is well specified. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is separated from the foregrounds using multifrequency data. The sky maps are consistent with the 7° FWHM Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) maps. We report more precise, but consistent, dipole and quadrupole values. The CMB anisotropy obeys Gaussian statistics with -58〈f<SUB>NL</SUB>〈134 (95% confidence level [CL]). The 2〈=l〈=900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic-variance-limited for l〈354, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 per mode to l=658. The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic features and a large-angle correlation from reionization. The optical depth of reionization is τ=0.17+/-0.04, which implies a reionization epoch of t<SUB>r</SUB>=180<SUP>+220</SUP><SUB>-80</SUB> Myr (95% CL) after the big bang at a redshift of z<SUB>r</SUB>=20<SUP>+10</SUP><SUB>-9</SUB> (95% CL) for a range of ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the presence of a significant warm dark matter density. A best-fit cosmological model to the CMB and other measures of large-scale structure works remarkably well with only a few parameters. The age of the best-fit universe is t<SUB>0</SUB>=13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. Decoupling was t<SUB>dec</SUB>=379<SUP>+8</SUP><SUB>-7</SUB> kyr after the big bang at a redshift of z<SUB>dec</SUB>=1089+/-1.

It appears that there may be progressively less fluctuation power on smaller scales, from WMAP to fine-scale CMB measurements to galaxies and finally to the Lyα forest. This may be accounted for with a running spectral index of scalar fluctuations, fitted as n<SUB>s</SUB>=0.93+/-0.03 at wavenumber k<SUB>0</SUB>=0.05 Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (l<SUB>eff</SUB>~700), with a slope of dn<SUB>s</SUB>/dlnk=-0.031<SUP>+0.016</SUP><SUB>-0.018</SUB> in the best-fit model. (For WMAP data alone, n<SUB>s</SUB>=0.99+/-0.04.) This flat universe model is composed of 4.4% baryons, 22% dark matter, and 73% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to w〈-0.78 (95% CL). Inflation theory is supported with n<SUB>s</SUB>~1, Ω<SUB>tot</SUB>~1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy, and superhorizon fluctuations implied by the temperature-polarization anticorrelations at decoupling.

The lack of CMB fluctuation power on the largest angular scales reported by COBE and confirmed by WMAP is intriguing. WMAP continues to operate, so results will improve.

138,"We review the dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated electron systems which is based on a mapping of lattice models onto quantum impurity models subject to a self-consistency condition. This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.",Dynamical mean-field theory of strongly correlated fermion systems and the limit of infinite dimensions
139,"A new generation of parton distribution functions with increased precision and quantitative estimates of uncertainties is presented. This work significantly extends previous CTEQ and other global analyses on two fronts: (i) a full treatment of available experimental correlated systematic errors for both new and old data sets; (ii) a systematic and pragmatic treatment of uncertainties of the parton distributions and their physical predictions, using a recently developed eigenvector-basis approach to the hessian method. The new gluon distribution is considerably harder than that of previous standard fits. A number of physics issues, particularly relating to the behavior of the gluon distribution, are addressed in more quantitative terms than before. Extensive results on the uncertainties of parton distributions at various scales, and on parton luminosity functions at the Tevatron RunII and the LHC, are presented. The latter provide the means to quickly estimate the uncertainties of a wide range of physical processes at these high-energy hadron colliders, based on current knowledge of the parton distributions. In particular, the uncertainties on the production cross sections of the W, Z at the Tevatron and the LHC are estimated to be +/-4% and +/-5%, respectively, and that of a light Higgs at the LHC to be +/-5%.",New Generation of Parton Distributions with Uncertainties from Global QCD Analysis
140,"This book is intended to provide a thorough introduction to the theory of general relativity. It is intended to serve as both a text for graduate students and a reference book for researchers. According to general relativity, as formulated by Einstein in 1915, the intrinsic, observer-independent, properties of spacetime are described by a spacetime metric, as in special relativity. The structure of spacetime is related to the matter content of spacetime. Manifolds and tensor fields are considered along with curvature, Einstein's equation, isotropic cosmology, the Schwarzschild solution, methods for solving Einstein's equation, causal structure, singularities, the initial value formulation, asymptotic flatness, black holes, spinors, and quantum effects in strong gravitational fields. Attention is also given to topological spaces, maps of manifolds, Lie derivatives, Killing fields, conformal transformations, and Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of Einstein's equation.",General relativity
141,"Methods are developed for discussing the photon statistics of arbitrary fields in fully quantum-mechanical terms. In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.",Coherent and Incoherent States of the Radiation Field

This observed correlation is herein interpreted in terms of those principles governing the interaction of the d-shells of the transition metals which were enunciated in the first paper of this series.

149,"We extend earlier ideas about the appearance of noncommutative geometry in string theory with a nonzero B-field. We identify a limit in which the entire string dynamics is described by a minimally coupled (supersymmetric) gauge theory on a noncommutative space, and discuss the corrections away from this limit. Our analysis leads us to an equivalence between ordinary gauge fields and noncommutative gauge fields, which is realized by a change of variables that can be described explicitly. This change of variables is checked by comparing the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld theory with its noncommutative counterpart. We obtain a new perspective on noncommutative gauge theory on a torus, its T-duality, and Morita equivalence. We also discuss the D0/D4 system, the relation to M-theory in DLCQ, and a possible noncommutative version of the six-dimensional (2,0) theory.",String theory and noncommutative geometry

In this paper some recent improvements in the analysis of magnetic neutron powder diffraction data are discussed. After an introduction to the subject, the main formulas governing the analysis of the Bragg magnetic scattering are summarized and shortly discussed. Next, we discuss the method of profile fitting without a structural model to get precise integrated intensities and refine the propagation vector(s) of the magnetic structure. The simulated annealing approach for magnetic structure determination is briefly discussed and, finally, some features of the program FullProf concerning the magnetic structure refinement are presented and discussed. The different themes are illustrated with simple examples.",Recent advances in magnetic structure determination by neutron powder diffraction
151,"It is suggested that the nucleon mass arises largely as a self-energy of some primary fermion field through the same mechanism as the appearance of energy gap in the theory of superconductivity. The idea can be put into a mathematical formulation utilizing a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation which regards real nucleons as quasi-particle excitations. We consider a simplified model of nonlinear four-fermion interaction which allows a Îł<SUB>5</SUB>-gauge group. An interesting consequence of the symmetry is that there arise automatically pseudoscalar zero-mass bound states of nucleon-antinucleon pair which may be regarded as an idealized pion. In addition, massive bound states of nucleon number zero and two are predicted in a simple approximation. The theory contains two parameters which can be explicitly related to observed nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon coupling constant. Some paradoxical aspects of the theory in connection with the Îł<SUB>5</SUB> transformation are discussed in detail.",Dynamical Model of Elementary Particles Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity.

152,"For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.",Quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator in a gas of ultracold atoms

159,"The conditions necessary in metals for the presence or absence of localized moments on solute ions containing inner shell electrons are analyzed. A self-consistent Hartree-Fock treatment shows that there is a sharp transition between the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state, depending on the density of states of free electrons, the s-d admixture matrix elements, and the Coulomb correlation integral in the d shell; that in the magnetic state the d polarization can be reduced rather severely to nonintegral values, without appreciable free electron polarization because of a compensation effect; and that in the nonmagnetic state the virtual localized d level tends to lie near the Fermi surface. It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d-d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.",Localized Magnetic States in Metals

The renormalization group is then developed in some detail, and applied to a variety of systems. The main dynamic universality classes are identified and characterized. It is found that the mode-coupling and renormalization group theories successfully explain available experimental data at the critical point of pure fluids, and binary mixtures, and at many magnetic phase transitions, but that a number of discrepancies exist with data at the superfluid transition of <SUP>4</SUP>He.",Theory of dynamic critical phenomena

164,"Recently, a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem has been proposed which does not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The gravitational and gauge interactions unite at the electroweak scale, and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due the existence of large new spatial dimensions. In this letter, we show that this framework can be embedded in string theory. These models have a perturbative description in the context of type I string theory. The gravitational sector consists of closed strings propagating in the higher-dimensional bulk, while ordinary matter consists of open strings living on D3-branes. This scenario raises the exciting possibility that the LHC and NLC will experimentally study ordinary aspects of string physics such as the production of narrow Regge-excitations of all standard model particles, as well more exotic phenomena involving strong gravity such as the production of black holes. The new dimensions can be probed by events with large missing energy carried off by gravitons escaping into the bulk. We finally discuss some important issues of model building, such as proton stability, gauge coupling unification and supersymmetry breaking.",New dimensions at a millimeter to a fermi and superstrings at a TeV

For a gas of large extent the effect of photon recoil momentum on coherence is calculated. The effect of a radiation pulse in exciting ""super-radiant"" states is discussed. The angular correlation between successive photons spontaneously emitted by a gas initially in thermal equilibrium is calculated.",Coherence in Spontaneous Radiation Processes

168,"The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases in traps is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Mean-field theory provides a framework to understand the main features of the condensation and the role of interactions between particles. Various properties of these systems are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the collective oscillations and the dynamics of the expansion, the condensate fraction and the thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach.",Theory of Bose-Einstein condensation in trapped gases

170,"Metal-insulator transitions are accompanied by huge resistivity changes, even over tens of orders of magnitude, and are widely observed in condensed-matter systems. This article presents the observations and current understanding of the metal-insulator transition with a pedagogical introduction to the subject. Especially important are the transitions driven by correlation effects associated with the electron-electron interaction. The insulating phase caused by the correlation effects is categorized as the Mott Insulator. Near the transition point the metallic state shows fluctuations and orderings in the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. The properties of these metals are frequently quite different from those of ordinary metals, as measured by transport, optical, and magnetic probes. The review first describes theoretical approaches to the unusual metallic states and to the metal-insulator transition. The Fermi-liquid theory treats the correlations that can be adiabatically connected with the noninteracting picture. Strong-coupling models that do not require Fermi-liquid behavior have also been developed. Much work has also been done on the scaling theory of the transition. A central issue for this review is the evaluation of these approaches in simple theoretical systems such as the Hubbard model and t-J models. Another key issue is strong competition among various orderings as in the interplay of spin and orbital fluctuations. Experimentally, the unusual properties of the metallic state near the insulating transition have been most extensively studied in d-electron systems. In particular, there is revived interest in transition-metal oxides, motivated by the epoch-making findings of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in manganites. The article reviews the rich phenomena of anomalous metallicity, taking as examples Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ru compounds. The diverse phenomena include strong spin and orbital fluctuations, mass renormalization effects, incoherence of charge dynamics, and phase transitions under control of key parameters such as band filling, bandwidth, and dimensionality. These parameters are experimentally varied by doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic fields. Much of the observed behavior can be described by the current theory. Open questions and future problems are also extracted from comparison between experimental results and theoretical achievements.",Metal-insulator transitions

172,"A grid of LTE model atmospheres is presented for effective temperatures ranging from 5500 to 50,000 K, gravities from the main sequence down to the radiation-pressure limit, and abundances solar, 1/10 solar, and 1/100 solar. The models were computed by use of a statistical distribution-function representation of the opacity of almost a million atomic lines. For each model the temperature structure, fluxes, UBV and uvby colors, bolometric correction, and Balmer line profiles are tabulated. The solar-abundance models are compared with narrow-, intermediate-, and wide-band photometry and found to be in good agreement with the observations for effective temperatures above 8000 K. Excellent agreement exists with the spectrophotometry and Balmer line profiles of Vega. A small systematic error in the colors of late A and F stars is probably due to an overstimate of convection in weakly convective models. This error does not seem to affect greatly the use of the predicted colors for differential studies. The solar model has approximately a 2% error in the V flux because molecular lines were not included.","Model atmospheres for G, F, A, B, and O stars."
173,"During strong-field multiphoton ionization, a wave packet is formed each time the laser field passes its maximum value. Within the first laser period after ionization there is a significant probability that the electron will return to the vicinity of the ion with very high kinetic energy. High-harmonic generation, multiphoton two-electron ejection, and very high energy above-threshold-ionization electrons are all conssequences of this electron-ion interaction. One important parameter which determines the strength of these effects is the rate at which the wave packet spreads in the direction perpendicular to the laser electric field; another is the polarization of the laser. It will be essential for experimentalists to be aware of these crucial parameters in future experiments.",Plasma perspective on strong field multiphoton ionization

177,"This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ""base ΛCDM"" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB> = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, a matter density parameter Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with n<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z_re=8.8<SUP>+1.7<SUB>-1.4</SUB>. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value N<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ m<SUB>ν</SUB> 〈 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | Ω<SUB>K</SUB> | 〈 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r<SUB>0.002</SUB>〈 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r<SUB>0.002</SUB> 〈 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ<SUP>2</SUP> potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets. </SUP>",Planck 2015 results. XIII.

181,"A systematic study is made of the non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics. The basic object is the two-point functions of various currents. At large Euclidean momenta q the non-perturbative contributions induce a series in ( Îź<SUP>2</SUP>/ q<SUP>2</SUP>) where Îź is some typical hadronic mass. The terms of this series are shown to be of two distinct types. The first few of them are connected with vacuum fluctuations of large size, and can be consistently accounted for within the Wilson operator expansion. On the other hand, in high orders small-size fluctuations show up and the high-order terms do not reduce (generally speaking) to the vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements of local operators. This signals the breakdown of the operator expansion. The corresponding critical dimension is found. We propose a Borel improvement of the power series. On one hand, it makes the two-point functions less sensitive to high-order terms, and on the other hand, it transforms the standard dispersion representation into a certain integral representation with exponential weight functions. As a result we obtain a set of the sum rules for the observable spectral densities which correlate the resonance properties to a few vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements. As the last bid to specify the sum rules we estimate the matrix elements involved and elaborate several techniques for this purpose.",QCD and resonance physics. theoretical foundations

183,"We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a ""gas"" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes ""self-similar"" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can ""bootstrap"" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal ""seed"" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves.

186,"We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m〉~1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m<SUB>c</SUB>~0.08 M<SUB>solar</SUB> and a variance in logarithmic mass σ~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m<SUB>c</SUB>~0.2 M<SUB>solar</SUB> and σ~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n<SUB>BD</SUB>~n<SUB>*</SUB>~0.1 pc<SUP>-3</SUP>. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages 〉~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m<SUB>c</SUB>~0.2-0.3 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfvénic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

198,"There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples.",Black Holes and Entropy

200,"Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples",Studies in astronomical time series analysis. II.

The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit.

208,"All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism—entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schrödinger—waited over 70years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form—the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.",Quantum entanglement

Status Solidi B 241, 624 (2004)]. While ZnO already has many industrial applications owing to its piezoelectric properties and band gap in the near ultraviolet, its applications to optoelectronic devices has not yet materialized due chiefly to the lack of p-type epitaxial layers. Very high quality what used to be called whiskers and platelets, the nomenclature for which gave way to nanostructures of late, have been prepared early on and used to deduce much of the principal properties of this material, particularly in terms of optical processes. The suggestion of attainment of p-type conductivity in the last few years has rekindled the long-time, albeit dormant, fervor of exploiting this material for optoelectronic applications. The attraction can simply be attributed to the large exciton binding energy of 60meV of ZnO potentially paving the way for efficient room-temperature exciton-based emitters, and sharp transitions facilitating very low threshold semiconductor lasers. The field is also fueled by theoretical predictions and perhaps experimental confirmation of ferromagnetism at room temperature for potential spintronics applications. This review gives an in-depth discussion of the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of ZnO in addition to the technological issues such as growth, defects, p-type doping, band-gap engineering, devices, and nanostructures.",A comprehensive review of ZnO materials and devices

211,"This paper presents the results of a functional-integral approach to the dynamics of a two-state system coupled to a dissipative environment. It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the ""spin-boson"" problem; (2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem; (3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space these errors are either very small in the limit of interest to us (the ""slow-tunneling"" limit) or can themselves be evaluated with satisfactory accuracy; (4) use of these results to obtain quantitative expressions for the dynamics of the system as a function of the spectral density J(ω) of its coupling to the environment. If J(ω) behaves as ω<SUP>s</SUP> for frequencies of the order of the tunneling frequency or smaller, the authors find for the ""unbiased"" case the following results: For s〈1 the system is localized at zero temperature, and at finite T relaxes incoherently at a rate proportional to exp-(T<SUB>0</SUB>T)<SUP>1-s</SUP>. For s〉2 it undergoes underdamped coherent oscillations for all relevant temperatures, while for 1〈s〈2 there is a crossover from coherent oscillation to overdamped relaxation as T increases. Exact expressions for the oscillation and/or relaxation rates are presented in all these cases. For the ""ohmic"" case, s=1, the qualitative nature of the behavior depends critically on the dimensionless coupling strength α as well as the temperature T: over most of the (α,T) plane (including the whole region α〉1) the behavior is an incoherent relaxation at a rate proportional to T<SUP>2α-1</SUP>, but for low T and 0〈α〈12 the authors predict a combination of damped coherent oscillation and incoherent background which appears to disagree with the results of all previous approximations. The case of finite bias is also discussed.",Dynamics of the dissipative two-state system

221,"We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10<SUP>10</SUP> dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10<SUP>5</SUP> per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million.

222,"The desire to use and control photons in a manner analogous to the control of electrons in solids has inspired great interest in such topics as the localization of light, microcavity quantum electrodynamics and near-field optics. A fundamental constraint in manipulating light is the extremely low transmittivity of apertures smaller than the wavelength of the incident photon. While exploring the optical properties of submicrometre cylindrical cavities in metallic films, we have found that arrays of such holes display highly unusual zero-order transmission spectra (where the incident and detected light are collinear) at wavelengths larger than the array period, beyond which no diffraction occurs. In particular, sharp peaks in transmission are observed at wavelengths as large as ten times the diameter of the cylinders. At these maxima the transmission efficiency can exceed unity (when normalized to the area of the holes), which is orders of magnitude greater than predicted by standard aperture theory. Our experiments provide evidence that these unusual optical properties are due to the coupling of light with plasmons - electronic excitations - on the surface of the periodically patterned metal film. Measurements of transmission as a function of the incident light angle result in a photonic band diagram. These findings may find application in novel photonic devices.",Extraordinary optical transmission through sub-wavelength hole arrays
223,"We investigate the possibility that radiative corrections may produce spontaneous symmetry breakdown in theories for which the semiclassical (tree) approximation does not indicate such breakdown. The simplest model in which this phenomenon occurs is the electrodynamics of massless scalar mesons. We find (for small coupling constants) that this theory more closely resembles the theory with an imaginary mass (the Abelian Higgs model) than one with a positive mass; spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, and the theory becomes a theory of a massive vector meson and a massive scalar meson. The scalar-to-vector mass ratio is computable as a power series in e, the electromagnetic coupling constant. We find, to lowest order, m<SUP>2</SUP>(S)m<SUP>2</SUP>(V)=(32Ď)(e<SUP>2</SUP>4Ď). We extend our analysis to non-Abelian gauge theories, and find qualitatively similar results. Our methods are also applicable to theories in which the tree approximation indicates the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breakdown, but does not give complete information about its character. (This typically occurs when the scalar-meson part of the Lagrangian admits a greater symmetry group than the total Lagrangian.) We indicate how to use our methods in these cases.",Radiative Corrections as the Origin of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

225,"We review in detail a number of approaches that have been adopted to try and explain the remarkable observation of our accelerating universe. In particular we discuss the arguments for and recent progress made towards understanding the nature of dark energy. We review the observational evidence for the current accelerated expansion of the universe and present a number of dark energy models in addition to the conventional cosmological constant, paying particular attention to scalar field models such as quintessence, K-essence, tachyon, phantom and dilatonic models. The importance of cosmological scaling solutions is emphasized when studying the dynamical system of scalar fields including coupled dark energy. We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations allowing us to confront them with the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure and demonstrate how it is possible in principle to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy by also using Supernovae Ia observational data. We also discuss in detail the nature of tracking solutions in cosmology, particle physics and braneworld models of dark energy, the nature of possible future singularities, the effect of higher order curvature terms to avoid a Big Rip singularity, and approaches to modifying gravity which leads to a late-time accelerated expansion without recourse to a new form of dark energy.",Dynamics of Dark Energy
226,"The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.",The Chemical Composition of the Sun
227,"We have discovered 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence for cosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration. These objects, discovered during the course of the GOODS ACS Treasury program, include 6 of the 7 highest redshift SNe Ia known, all at z〉1.25, and populate the Hubble diagram in unexplored territory. The luminosity distances to these objects and to 170 previously reported SNe Ia have been determined using empirical relations between light-curve shape and luminosity. A purely kinematic interpretation of the SN Ia sample provides evidence at the greater than 99% confidence level for a transition from deceleration to acceleration or, similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46+/-0.13.

243,"The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures.

Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the standard set was optimized for the anion HF+1+2 energy. The results for sulfur are then used to assist in determining double zeta, triple zeta, and quadruple zeta basis sets for the remainder of the second row of the p block.",Gaussian basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations.

247,"We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1Â° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5Â° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.","Global analyses of sea surface temperature, sea ice, and night marine air temperature since the late nineteenth century"
248,A model is proposed for the evolution of the profile of a growing interface. The deterministic growth is solved exactly and exhibits nontrivial relaxation patterns. The stochastic version is studied by dynamic renormalization-group techniques and by mappings to Burger's equation and to a random directed polymer problem.

The relations of constraint remain perfectly fulfilled at each step of the trajectory despite the approximate character of numerical integration. The method is applied to a molecular dynamics simulation of a liquid of 64 n-butane molecules and compared to a simulation using generalized coordinates. The method should be useful for molecular dynamics calculations on large molecules with internal degrees of freedom.,Numerical Integration of the Cartesian Equations of Motion of a System with Constraints: Molecular Dynamics of n-Alkanes
250,"Measurements of HÎą, H I, and CO distributions in 61 normal spiral galaxies are combined with published far-infrared and CO observations of 36 infrared-selected starburst galaxies, in order to study the form of the global star formation law over the full range of gas densities and star formation rates (SFRs) observed in galaxies. The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.",The Global Schmidt Law in Star-forming Galaxies
251,"We study the effects of spin orbit interactions on the low energy electronic structure of a single plane of graphene. We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two-dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.",Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Graphene

256,"A theory of many-particle systems is developed to formulate transport, collective motion, and Brownian motion from a unified, statistical-mechanical point of view. This is done by, first, rewriting the equation of motion in a generalized form of the Langevin equation in the stochastic theory of Brownian motion and then, either studying the average evolution of a non-equilibrium system or calculating the linear response function to a mechanical perturbation. (1) An expression is obtained for the damping function phi(t), the real part of whose Laplace transform gives the damping constnat of collective motion. (2) A general equation of motion for a set of dynamical variables A(t) is derived, which takes the form (d/dt)A(t) - ihat{omega} \cdot A(t) + int^t_0phi(t-s)\cdot A(s)ds = f(t), where hat{omega} is a frequency matrix determining the collective oscillation of A(t). The quantity f(t) consists of those terms which are either non-linear in A(s), t geqq s geqq 0, or dependent on the other degrees-of-freedom explicitly, and its time-correlation function is connected with the damping function phi(t) by (f(t_1), f(t_2)^*) = phi(t_1 - t_2)\cdot(A, A^*). (3) An expression is obtained for the linear after-effect function to thermal disturbances such as temperature gradient and strain tensor. Both the conjugate fluxes and the time dependence differ from those of the mechanical response function. The conjugate fluxes are textit{random} parts of the fluxes of the state variables, thus depending on temperature. (4) The difference in the time dependence arises from a special property of the time evolution of f(t) and ensures that the damping function and the thermal after-effect function are determined by the microscopic processes in strong contrast to the mechanical response function. The difficulty of the plateau value problem in the previous theories of Brownian motion and transport coefficients is thus removed. (5) The theory is illustrated by dealing with the motion of inhomogeneous magnetization in ferromagnets and the Brownian motion of the collective coordinates of fluids. (6) Explicit expressions are derived for the thermal after-effect functions and the transport coefficients of multi-component systems.","Transport, Collective Motion, and Brownian Motion"
257,"A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5M<SUB>solar</SUB> and near 0.08M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα~0.5 between 0.1 and 1M<SUB>solar</SUB> than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.",On the variation of the initial mass function

262,"With increasing availability of good all-electron LCAO MO (LCAO molecular orbital) wave functions for molecules, a systematic procedure for obtaining maximum insight from such data has become desirable. An analysis in quantitative form is given here in terms of breakdowns of the electronic population into partial and total ``gross atomic populations,'' or into partial and total ``net atomic populations'' together with ``overlap populations.'' ``Gross atomic populations'' distribute the electrons almost perfectly among the various AOs (atomic orbitals) of the various atoms in the molecule. From these numbers, a definite figure is obtained for the amount of promotion (e.g., from 2s to 2p) in each atom; and also for the gross charge Q on each atom if the bonds are polar. The total overlap population for any pair of atoms in a molecule is in general made up of positive and negative contributions. If the total overlap population between two atoms is positive, they are bonded; if negative, they are antibonded. Tables of gross atomic populations and overlap populations, also gross atomic charges Q, computed from SCF (self-consistent field) LCAO-MO data on CO and H<SUB>2</SUB>O, are given. The amount of s-p promotion is found to be nearly the same for the O atom in CO and in H<SUB>2</SUB>O (0.14 electron in CO and 0.15e in H<SUB>2</SUB>O). For the C atom in CO it is 0.50e. For the N atom in N<SUB>2</SUB> it is 0.26e according to calculations by Scherr. In spite of very strong polarity in the π bonds in CO, the σ and π overlap populations are very similar to those in N<SUB>2</SUB>. In CO the total overlap population for the π electrons is about twice that for the σ electrons. The most easily ionized electrons of CO are in an MO such that its gross atomic population is 94% localized on the carbon atom; these electrons account for the (weak) electron donor properties of CO. A comparison between changes of bond lengths observed on removal of an electron from one or another MO of CO and H<SUB>2</SUB>, and corresponding changes in computed overlap populations, shows good correlation. Several other points of interest are discussed.",Electronic Population Analysis on LCAO-MO Molecular Wave Functions. I

It is proposed that the various integrals be obtained as disposable constants, so that the tight binding method will agree with accurate calculations at symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for which these calculations have been made, and that the LCAO method then be used for making calculations throughout the Brillouin zone. A general discussion of the method is given, including tables of matrix components of energy for simple cubic, face-centered and body-centered cubic, and diamond structures. Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism.

268,"Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant Λ. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaître model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy.

272,"Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) provide two ways of protecting quantum states from interaction with the environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled pure states are extracted, with some yield D, from a mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an arbitrary quantum state \|ξ〉 can be transmitted at some rate Q through a noisy channel χ without degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-way classical communication and acting on mixed state M^(χ) (obtained by sharing halves of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs through a channel χ) yields a QECC on χ with rate Q=D, and vice versa. We compare the amount of entanglement E(M) required to prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the amounts D<SUB>1</SUB>(M) and D<SUB>2</SUB>(M) that can be locally distilled from it by EPPs using one- and two-way classical communication, respectively, and give an exact expression for E(M) when M is Bell diagonal. While EPPs require classical communication, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not increased by adding one-way classical communication. However, both D and Q can be increased by adding two-way communication. We show that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a 50% depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable transmission of quantum states if two-way communication is available, but cannot be used if only one-way communication is available. We exhibit a family of codes based on universal hashing able to achieve an asymptotic Q (or D) of 1-S for simple noise models, where S is the error entropy. We also obtain a specific, simple 5-bit single-error-correcting quantum block code. We prove that iff a QECC results in high fidelity for the case of no error then the QECC can be recast into a form where the encoder is the matrix inverse of the decoder.",Mixed-state entanglement and quantum error correction

282,"There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models.

285,"Over the last two decades, stochastic resonance has continuously attracted considerable attention. The term is given to a phenomenon that is manifest in nonlinear systems whereby generally feeble input information (such as a weak signal) can be be amplified and optimized by the assistance of noise. The effect requires three basic ingredients: (i) an energetic activation barrier or, more generally, a form of threshold; (ii) a weak coherent input (such as a periodic signal); (iii) a source of noise that is inherent in the system, or that adds to the coherent input. Given these features, the response of the system undergoes resonance-like behavior as a function of the noise level; hence the name stochastic resonance. The underlying mechanism is fairly simple and robust. As a consequence, stochastic resonance has been observed in a large variety of systems, including bistable ring lasers, semiconductor devices, chemical reactions, and mechanoreceptor cells in the tail fan of a crayfish. In this paper, the authors report, interpret, and extend much of the current understanding of the theory and physics of stochastic resonance. They introduce the readers to the basic features of stochastic resonance and its recent history. Definitions of the characteristic quantities that are important to quantify stochastic resonance, together with the most important tools necessary to actually compute those quantities, are presented. The essence of classical stochastic resonance theory is presented, and important applications of stochastic resonance in nonlinear optics, solid state devices, and neurophysiology are described and put into context with stochastic resonance theory. More elaborate and recent developments of stochastic resonance theory are discussed, ranging from fundamental quantum properties-being important at low temperatures-over spatiotemporal aspects in spatially distributed systems, to realizations in chaotic maps.

292,"We present updated leading-order, next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order parton distribution functions (“MSTW 2008”) determined from global analysis of hard-scattering data within the standard framework of leading-twist fixed-order collinear factorisation in the overline{MS} scheme. These parton distributions supersede the previously available “MRST” sets and should be used for the first LHC data taking and for the associated theoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross sections, which constrain the strange-quark and -antiquark distributions, and Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated from the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major changes compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions obtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.",Parton distributions for the LHC

It is found that various mixtures consisting of graphite, silicon carbide, enstatite, olivine, iron, and magnetite are acceptable, that all the acceptable mixtures contain spherical uncoated graphite particles, and that graphite is the main contributor to the 2160-A feature. The required particle-size distribution is shown to be quite broad, with approximately a power-law distribution, for all substances considered. The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a stochastic process in grain formation",The size distribution of interstellar grains.

297,"A broad class of astronomical accretion disks is presently shown to be dynamically unstable to axisymmetric disturbances in the presence of a weak magnetic field, an insight with consequently broad applicability to gaseous, differentially-rotating systems. In the first part of this work, a linear analysis is presented of the instability, which is local and extremely powerful; the maximum growth rate, which is of the order of the angular rotation velocity, is independent of the strength of the magnetic field. Fluid motions associated with the instability directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field components. In the second part of this investigation, the scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and the Alfven velocity is demonstrated, and the independence of the maximum growth rate from magnetic field strength is confirmed.",A Powerful Local Shear Instability in Weakly Magnetized Disks.

298,"The Becker-Kersten treatment of domain boundary movements is widely applicable in the interpretation of magnetization curves, but it does not account satisfactorily for the higher coercivities obtained, for example, in permanent magnet alloys. It is suggested that in many ferromagnetic materials there may occur 'particles' (this term including atomic segregates or 'islands' in alloys), distinct in magnetic character from the general matrix, and below the critical size, depending on shape, for which domain boundary formation is energetically possible. For such single-domain particles, change of magnetization can take place only by rotation of the magnetization vector, I<SUB>0</SUB>. As the field changes continuously, the resolved magnetization, I<SUB>H</SUB>, may change discontinuously at critical values, H<SUB>0</SUB>, of the field. The character of the magnetization curves depends on the degree of magnetic anisotropy of the particle, and on the orientation of 'easy axes' with respect to the field. The magnetic anisotropy may arise from the shape of the particle, from magneto-crystalline effects, and from strain. A detailed quantitative treatment is given of the effect of shape anisotropy when the particles have the form of ellipsoids of revolution (section section 2,3,4), and a less detailed treatment for the general ellipsoidal form (section 5). For the first it is convenient to use the non-dimensional parameter h, such that h = H/(|N<SUB>a</SUB>-N<SUB>b</SUB>|) I<SUB>0</SUB>, N<SUB>a</SUB> and N<SUB>b</SUB> being the demagnetization coefficients along the polar and equatorial axes. The results are presented in tables and diagrams giving the variation with h of I<SUB>H</SUB>/I<SUB>0</SUB>. For the special limiting form of the oblate spheroid there is no hysteresis. For the prolate spheroid, as the orientation angle, θ , varies from 0 to 90 degrees, the cyclic magnetization curves change from a rectangular form with |h<SUB>0</SUB>| = 1, to a linear non-hysteretic form, with an interesting sequence of intermediate forms. Exact expressions are obtained for the dependence of h<SUB>0</SUB> and θ , and curves for random distribution are computed. All the numerical results are applicable when the anisotropy is due to longitudinal stress, when h = HI<SUB>0</SUB>/3 λ σ , where λ is the saturation magnetostriction coefficient, and σ the stress. The results also apply to magneto-crystalline anisotropy in the important and representative case in which there is a unique axis of easy magnetization as for hexagonal cobalt. Estimates are made of the magnitude of the effect of the various types of anisotropy. For iron the maximum coercivities, for the most favourable orientation, due to the magneto-crystalline and strain effects are about 400 and 600 respectively. These values are exceeded by those due to the shape effect in prolate spheroids if the dimensional ratio, m, is greater than 1 \cdot 1; for m = 10, the corresponding value would be about 10,000 (section 7). A fairly precise estimate is made of the lower limit for the equatorial diameter of a particle in the form of a prolate spheroid below which boundary formation cannot occur. As m varies from 1 (the sphere) to 10, this varies from 1 \cdot 5 to 6 \cdot 1 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> for iron, and from 6 \cdot 2 to 25 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> for nickel (section 6). A discussion is given (section 7) of the application of these results to (a) non-ferromagnetic metals and alloys containing ferromagnetic 'impurities', (b) powder magnets, (c) high coercivity alloys of the dispersion hardening type. In connexion with (c) the possible bearing on the effects of cooling in a magnetic field is indicated.",A Mechanism of Magnetic Hysteresis in Heterogeneous Alloys
299,"We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P(k) from over 200 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other data. Our results are consistent with a “vanilla” flat adiabatic cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant without tilt (n<SUB>s</SUB>=1), running tilt, tensor modes, or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1σ constraints on the Hubble parameter from h≈0.74<SUP>+0.18</SUP><SUB>-0.07</SUB> to h≈0.70<SUP>+0.04</SUP><SUB>-0.03</SUB>, on the matter density from Ω<SUB>m</SUB>≈0.25±0.10 to Ω<SUB>m</SUB>≈0.30±0.04 (1σ) and on neutrino masses from 〈11 to 〈0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis of WMAP and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive consistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis techniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the physical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using different data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the assumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the measured age of the Universe tightens from t<SUB>0</SUB>≈16.3<SUP>+2.3</SUP><SUB>-1.8</SUB> Gyr to t<SUB>0</SUB>≈14.1<SUP>+1.0</SUP><SUB>-0.9</SUB> Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data.

300,"The cosmological consequences of a pervasive, rolling, self-interacting, homogeneous scalar field are investigated. A number of models in which the energy density of the scalar field red-shifts in a specific manner are studied. In these models the current epoch is chosen to be scalar-field dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density parameter, ฮฉ<SUB>dyn~0.2</SUB>, and zero spatial curvature. The required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear'' and decreases in magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special solution of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests of gravitation theory. The Eรถtvรถs-Dicke measurements strongly constrain the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational) fields. Nucleosynthesis proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model. In linear perturbation theory the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in the baryon-dominated epoch, do not differ significantly from the canonical scenario, while the presence of a substantial amount of homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts inhibits the growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density in the scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic gravitational fields, either in the radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated epochs. On the basis of this effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial curvature preferred by inflation.",Cosmological consequences of a rolling homogeneous scalar field

302,"The nucleosynthetic yield of isotopes lighter than A = 66 (zinc) is determined for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities including stars of 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, and 40 M<SUB>sun</SUB> and metallicities Z = 0, l0<SUP>-4</SUP>, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass grid is employed for nonsolar metallicities). Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity (typically 1.2 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs), and the explosive modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical <SUP>12</SUP>C(α,γ) <SUP>16</SUP>O reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations. The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a ""mass cut"" farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M<SUB>sun</SUB> will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact structure and reduced mass loss.",The Evolution and Explosion of Massive Stars.

It was developed for determining ion range and damage distributions as well as angular and energy distributions of backscattered and transmitted ions. The computer program provides particularly high computer efficiency, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for determining nuclear scattering angles based on the MoliĂ¨re potential, and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high energies. With these improvements it becomes feasible for the first time to assess accurately both low and high energy problems with high precision using a single simulation program.",A Monte Carlo computer program for the transport of energetic ions in amorphous targets
306,"The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability.

312,"It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.","The Determination of the Elastic Field of an Ellipsoidal Inclusion, and Related Problems"
313,"We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter ΛCDM model.

The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their ΛCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r 〈 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \Omega _k = -0.0027^{+ 0.0039}_{- 0.0038}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m <SUB>ν</SUB> 〈 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N <SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed.

320,"We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_∙. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_∙ and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_∙ ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_∙ = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_∙. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_∙/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51.

This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z~1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Ω<SUB>m</SUB>h<SUP>2</SUP> to 8% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.

322,"The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available.

A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics.",A universal instability of many-dimensional oscillator systems

325,"A kinetic theory approach to collision processes in ionized and neutral gases is presented. This approach is adequate for the unified treatment of the dynamic properties of gases over a continuous range of pressures from the Knudsen limit to the high-pressure limit where the aerodynamic equations are valid. It is also possible to satisfy the correct microscopic boundary conditions. The method consists in altering the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation. The modified collision terms are constructed so that each collision conserves particle number, momentum, and energy; other characteristics such as persistence of velocities and angular dependence may be included. The present article illustrates the technique for a simple model involving the assumption of a collision time independent of velocity; this model is applied to the study of small amplitude oscillations of one-component ionized and neutral gases. The initial value problem for unbounded space is solved by performing a Fourier transformation on the space variables and a Laplace transformation on the time variable. For uncharged gases there results the correct adiabatic limiting law for sound-wave propagation at high pressures and, in addition, one obtains a theory of absorption and dispersion of sound for arbitrary pressures. For ionized gases the difference in the nature of the organization in the low-pressure plasma oscillations and in high-pressure sound-type oscillations is studied. Two important cases are distinguished. If the wavelengths of the oscillations are long compared to either the Debye length or the mean free path, a small change in frequency is obtained as the collision frequency varies from zero to infinity. The accompanying absorption is small; it reaches its maximum value when the collision frequency equals the plasma frequency. The second case refers to waves shorter than both the Debye length and the mean free path; these waves are characterized by a very heavy absorption.",A Model for Collision Processes in Gases. I.

327,"Starburst99 is a comprehensive set of model predictions for spectrophotometric and related properties of galaxies with active star formation. The models are an improved and extended version of the data set previously published by Leitherer & Heckman.

Several predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here for the first time.

331,"QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Għ/c<SUP>3</SUP>)<SUP>1/2</SUP> ~ 10<SUP>-33</SUP> cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ~ 10<SUP>17</SUP> s which is very long compared to the Planck time ~ 10<SUP>-43</SUP> s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ~ 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (Msolar/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole<SUP>1</SUP>. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 10<SUP>71</SUP> (Msolar/M)<SUP>-3</SUP> s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe<SUP>2</SUP>. Any such black hole of mass less than 10<SUP>15</SUP> g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 10<SUP>30</SUP> erg would be released in the last 0.1 s.

333,"We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of Îź<SUB>0</SUB>(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy.

The data for 47 stars are compared with OAO 2 results, and ratios of gas to E(B-V) color excess are computed for 30 'intercloud' stars, 45 'cloud' stars, and the combined sample of 75 stars. A definitive value of 5.8 x 10 to the 21st power atoms/sq cm per mag is obtained for the mean ratio of total neutral hydrogen to color excess, indicating that this ratio seems to be a constant, independent of location in the sky, except possibly toward stars with anomalous extinction. The anomalous ratio determined for Rho Oph is examined, and the galactic distribution of neutral hydrogen is evaluated. The following values are estimated for matter in the galactic plane within 500 pc of the sun: a total mean hydrogen space density of 1.15 atoms/cu cm, a mean H2 space density of 0.143 molecule/cu cm (possibly a lower limit), and a mean H I space density of 0.86 atom/cu cm (a possible overestimate).",A survey of interstellar H I from Lalpha absorption measurements.

336,"Quantum computers promise to increase greatly the efficiency of solving problems such as factoring large integers, combinatorial optimization and quantum physics simulation. One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.",A scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics
337,"Multilayers composed of many thin films of GaAs and GaAs <SUB>0·5</SUB>P <SUB>0·5</SUB> were grown epitaxially on GaAs surfaces inclined at a few degrees to (001). Examination of the multilayers by transmission and scanning electron microscopy has revealed that the interfaces between layers were made up of large coherent areas separated by long straight misfit dislocations. The Burgers vectors of the dislocations were inclined at 45° to (001) and were of type 1/2a 〈110〉. Dislocations in adjacent interfaces were usually not independent of one another. They often lay on the same slip plane and when this was so they were clearly products of the same source. The layer thickness at which misfit dislocations were formed was in satisfactory agreement with the predicted thickness. However, the fraction of the total misfit accommodated by dislocations (once the critical thickness for dislocation generation was passed) was much smaller than predicted. This large discrepancy seems to arise from difficulties associated with the creation of misfit dislocations. Although there are many processes which can impede dislocation generation, the most important one in GaAs/GaAs <SUB>0·5</SUB>P <SUB>0·5</SUB> multilayers appears to be the impaction of dislocations on one glide plane against dislocations in another.",Defects in epitaxial multilayers.

338,"The interaction between spin waves and itinerant electrons is considerably enhanced in the vicinity of an interface between normal and ferromagnetic layers in metallic thin films. This leads to a local increase of the Gilbert damping parameter which characterizes spin dynamics. When a dc current crosses this interface, stimulated emission of spin waves is predicted to take place. Beyond a certain critical current density, the spin damping becomes negative; a spontaneous precession of the magnetization is predicted to arise. This is the magnetic analog of the injection laser. An extra dc voltage appears across the interface, given by an expression similar to that for the Josephson voltage across a superconducting junction.",Emission of spin waves by a magnetic multilayer traversed by a current

359,"The phase diagrams and phase transitions of bosons with short-ranged repulsive interactions moving in periodic and/or random external potentials at zero temperature are investigated with emphasis on the superfluid-insulator transition induced by varying a parameter such as the density. Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ``ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ``Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential. The Bose glass phase is characterized by a finite compressibility, no gap, but an infinite superfluid susceptibility. In the presence of disorder the transition to superfluidity is argued to occur only from the Bose glass phase, and never directly from the Mott insulator. This zero-temperature superfluid-insulator transition is studied via generalizations of the Josephson scaling relation for the superfluid density at the ordinary λ transition, highlighting the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. The transition is found to have a dynamic critical exponent z exactly equal to d and correlation length and order-parameter correlation exponents ν and η which satisfy the bounds ν〉=2/d and η〈=2-d, respectively. It is argued that the superfluid-insulator transition in the presence of disorder may have an upper critical dimension d<SUB>c</SUB> which is infinite, but a perturbative renormalization-group calculation wherein the critical exponents have mean-field values for weak disorder above d=4 is also discussed. Many of these conclusions are verified by explicit calculations on a model of one-dimensional bosons in the presence of both random and periodic potentials. The general results are applied to experiments on <SUP>4</SUP>He absorbed in porous media such as Vycor. Some measurable properties of the superfluid onset are predicted exactly [e.g., the exponent x relating the λ transition temperature to the zero-temperature superfluid density is found to be d/2(d-1)], while stringent bounds are placed on others. Analysis of preliminary data is consistent with these predictions.",Boson localization and the superfluid-insulator transition

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems.

Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.",Galaxy morphology in rich clusters: implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies.

364,"Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d 〈 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d 〉 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e<SUP>2</SUP>/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck’s constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.",Quantum Spin Hall Insulator State in HgTe Quantum Wells

366,"The exchange of energy between a system of nuclear spins immersed in a strong magnetic field, and the heat reservoir consisting of the other degrees of freedom (the ""lattice"") of the substance containing the magnetic nuclei, serves to bring the spin system into equilibrium at a finite temperature. In this condition the system can absorb energy from an applied radiofrequency field. With the absorption of energy, however, the spin temperature tends to rise and the rate of absorption to decrease.

The interaction among the magnetic nuclei, with which a characteristic time T2' is associated, contributes to the width of the absorption line. Both interactions have been studied in a variety of substances, but with the emphasis on liquids containing hydrogen. Magnetic resonance absorption is observed by means of a radiofrequency bridge; the magnetic field at the sample is modulated at a low frequency. A detailed analysis of the method by which T<SUB>1</SUB> is derived from saturation experiments is given. Relaxation times observed range from 10<SUP>-4</SUP> to 10<SUP>2</SUP> seconds. In liquids T<SUB>1</SUB> ordinarily decreases with increasing viscosity, in some cases reaching a minimum value after which it increases with further increase in viscosity. The line width meanwhile increases monotonically from an extremely small value toward a value determined by the spin-spin interaction in the rigid lattice. The effect of paramagnetic ions in solution upon the proton relaxation time and line width has been investigated. The relaxation time and line width in ice have been measured at various temperatures. The results can be explained by a theory which takes into account the effect of the thermal motion of the magnetic nuclei upon the spin-spin interaction. The local magnetic field produced at one nucleus by neighboring magnetic nuclei, or even by electronic magnetic moments of paramagnetic ions, is spread out into a spectrum extending to frequencies of the order of 1τ<SUB>c</SUB>, where τ<SUB>c</SUB> is a correlation time associated with the local Brownian motion and closely related to the characteristic time which occurs in Debye's theory of polar liquids. If the nuclear Larmor frequency ω is much less than 1τ<SUB>c</SUB>, the perturbations caused by the local field nearly average out, T<SUB>1</SUB> is inversely proportional to τ<SUB>c</SUB>, and the width of the resonance line, in frequency, is about 1T<SUB>1</SUB>. A similar situation is found in hydrogen gas where τ<SUB>c</SUB> is the time between collisions. In very viscous liquids and in some solids where ωτ<SUB>c</SUB>〉1, a quite different behavior is predicted, and observed. Values of τ<SUB>c</SUB> for ice, inferred from nuclear relaxation measurements, correlate well with dielectric dispersion data. Formulas useful in estimating the detectability of magnetic resonance absorption in various cases are derived in the appendix.",Relaxation Effects in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Absorption

368,"The term ``sensitized luminescence'' in crystalline phosphors refers to the phenomenon whereby an impurity (activator, or emitter) is enabled to luminesce upon the absorption of light in a different type of center (sensitizer, or absorber) and upon the subsequent radiationless transfer of energy from the sensitizer to the activator. The resonance theory of Fรถrster, which involves only allowed transitions, is extended to include transfer by means of forbidden transitions which, it is concluded, are responsible for the transfer in all inorganic systems yet investigated. The transfer mechanisms of importance are, in order of decreasing strength, the overlapping of the electric dipole fields of the sensitizer and the activator, the overlapping of the dipole field of the sensitizer with the quadrupole field of the activator, and exchange effects. These mechanisms will give rise to ``sensitization'' of about 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP>, 10<SUP>2</SUP>, and 30 lattice sites surrounding each sensitizer in typical systems. The dependence of transfer efficiency upon sensitizer and activator concentrations and on temperature are discussed.

This reformulation allows a natural extension of the method to potentials of the form 1/r<SUP>p</SUP> with pâĽ1. Furthermore, efficient calculation of the virial tensor follows. Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 Ă or less.",A smooth particle mesh Ewald method
370,"Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting ""subjective statistical mechanics,"" the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.",Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics

A ferromagnetic crystal exhibits a stable and switchable magnetization that arises through the quantum mechanical phenomenon of exchange. There are very few `multiferroic' materials that exhibit both of these properties, but the `magnetoelectric' coupling of magnetic and electrical properties is a more general and widespread phenomenon.

375,"Parts I and II deal with the theory of crystal growth, parts III and IV with the form (on the atomic scale) of a crystal surface in equilibrium with the vapour. In part I we calculate the rate of advance of monomolecular steps (i.e. the edges of incomplete monomolecular layers of the crystal) as a function of supersaturation in the vapour and the mean concentration of kinks in the steps. We show that in most cases of growth from the vapour the rate of advance of steps will be independent of their crystallographic orientation, so that a growing closed step will be circular. We also find the rate of advance for parallel sequences of steps, and the dependence of rate of advance upon the curvature of the step. In part II we find the resulting rate of growth and the steepness of the growth cones or growth pyramids when the persistence of steps is due to the presence of dislocations. The cases in which several or many dislocations are involved are analysed in some detail; it is shown that they will commonly differ little from the case of a single dislocation. The rate of growth of a surface containing dislocations is shown to be proportional to the square of the supersaturation for low values and to the first power for high values of the latter. Volmer & Schultze's (1931) observations on the rate of growth of iodine crystals from the vapour can be explained in this way. The application of the same ideas to growth of crystals from solution is briefly discussed. Part III deals with the equilibrium structure of steps, especially the statistics of kinks in steps, as dependent on temperature, binding energy parameters, and crystallographic orientation. The shape and size of a two-dimensional nucleus (i.e. an 'island' of new monolayer of crystal on a completed layer) in unstable equilibrium with a given supersaturation at a given temperature is obtained, whence a corrected activation energy for two-dimensional nucleation is evaluated. At moderately low supersaturations this is so large that a perfect crystal would have no observable growth rate. For a crystal face containing two screw dislocations of opposite sense, joined by a step, the activation energy is still very large when their distance apart is less than the diameter of the corresponding critical nucleus; but for any greater separation it is zero. Part IV treats as a 'co-operative phenomenon' the temperature dependence of the structure of the surface of a perfect crystal, free from steps at absolute zero. It is shown that such a surface remains practically flat (save for single adsorbed molecules and vacant surface sites) until a transition temperature is reached, at which the roughness of the surface increases very rapidly ('surface melting'). Assuming that the molecules in the surface are all in one or other of two levels, the results of Onsager (1944) for two-dimensional ferromagnets can be applied with little change. The transition temperature is of the order of, or higher than, the melting-point for crystal faces with nearest neighbour interactions in both directions (e.g. (100) faces of simple cubic or (111) or (100) faces of face-centred cubic crystals). When the interactions are of second nearest neighbour type in one direction (e.g. (110) faces of s.c. or f.c.c. crystals), the transition temperature is lower and corresponds to a surface melting of second nearest neighbour bonds. The error introduced by the assumed restriction to two available levels is investigated by a generalization of Bethe's method (1935) to larger numbers of levels. This method gives an anomalous result for the two-level problem. The calculated transition temperature decreases substantially on going from two to three levels, but remains practically the same for larger numbers.",The Growth of Crystals and the Equilibrium Structure of their Surfaces

378,"A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.",Core condensation in heavy halos: a two-stage theory for galaxy formation and clustering.

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter Îť which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 1/2 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.",Two soluble models of an antiferromagnetic chain

A systematic consideration of the required properties of gate dielectrics indicates that the key guidelines for selecting an alternative gate dielectric are (a) permittivity, band gap, and band alignment to silicon, (b) thermodynamic stability, (c) film morphology, (d) interface quality, (e) compatibility with the current or expected materials to be used in processing for CMOS devices, (f) process compatibility, and (g) reliability. Many dielectrics appear favorable in some of these areas, but very few materials are promising with respect to all of these guidelines. A review of current work and literature in the area of alternate gate dielectrics is given. Based on reported results and fundamental considerations, the pseudobinary materials systems offer large flexibility and show the most promise toward successful integration into the expected processing conditions for future CMOS technologies, especially due to their tendency to form at interfaces with Si (e.g. silicates). These pseudobinary systems also thereby enable the use of other high-Îş materials by serving as an interfacial high-Îş layer. While work is ongoing, much research is still required, as it is clear that any material which is to replace SiO<SUB>2</SUB> as the gate dielectric faces a formidable challenge.

384,"Working within the framework of perturbation theory, we show that the axial-vector vertex in spinor electrodynamics has anomalous properties which disagree with those found by the formal manipulation of field equations. Specifically, because of the presence of closed-loop ""triangle diagrams,"" the divergence of axial-vector current is not the usual expression calculated from the field equations, and the axial-vector current does not satisfy the usual Ward identity. One consequence is that, even after the external-line wave-function renormalizations are made, the axial-vector vertex is still divergent in fourth- (and higher-) order perturbation theory. A corollary is that the radiative corrections to ν<SUB>l</SUB>l elastic scattering in the local current-current theory diverge in fourth (and higher) order. A second consequence is that, in massless electrodynamics, despite the fact that the theory is invariant under γ<SUB>5</SUB> tranformations, the axial-vector current is not conserved. In an Appendix we demonstrate the uniqueness of the triangle diagrams, and discuss a possible connection between our results and the π<SUP>0</SUP>--〉2γ and η--〉2γ decays. In particular, we argue that as a result of triangle diagrams, the equations expressing partial conservation of axial-vector current (PCAC) for the neutral members of the axial-vector-current octet must be modified in a well-defined manner, which completely alters the PCAC predictions for the π<SUP>0</SUP> and the η two-photon decays.",Axial-Vector Vertex in Spinor Electrodynamics

A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole. The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles. Finally, the work of Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief on scalar geons is corrected, and the spherically symmetric coupled scalar-gravitation Hamiltonian is presented in the hope that someone can apply it to the problem of black-hole evaporation.",Notes on black-hole evaporation

It is shown that a centrifugally driven outflow of matter from the disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes an angle of less than 60 deg with disk surface. At large distances the outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically dominated corona.",Hydromagnetic flows from accretion disks and the production of radio jets.

412,"A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a ""Coulomb hole"" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k, k'). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.",New Method for Calculating the One-Particle Green's Function with Application to the Electron-Gas Problem

414,"Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the Î˝=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the Î˝=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.",Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation

Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop experiment.

416,"We propose a form for the exchange-correlation potential in local-density band theory, appropriate for Mott insulators. The idea is to use the ``constrained-local-density-approximation'' Hubbard parameter U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-T<SUB>c</SUB> compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts that LiNiO<SUB>2</SUB> is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal.

418,"We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ〉~40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ∊=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z〉~1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

426,"Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene, both because of its rich physics and its high mobility. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films or requires high voltages. Although single layers of MoS<SUB>2</SUB> have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm<SUP>2</SUP> V<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> range are too low for practical devices.

430,"Coherent preparation by laser light of quantum states of atoms and molecules can lead to quantum interference in the amplitudes of optical transitions. In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.",Electromagnetically induced transparency: Optics in coherent media

434,"This paper considers the question of the large-scale gravitational stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large. Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From that, and the observed j# and K, together with their uncertainties, this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.",On the gravitational stability of a disk of stars.

Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations.

Predictions are given for the scaling behavior, angular dependence, helicity structure, and normalization of elastic and inelastic form factors and large-angle exclusive scattering amplitudes for hadrons and photons. We prove that these reactions are dominated by quark and gluon subprocesses at short distances, and thus that the dimensional-counting rules for the power-law falloff of these amplitudes with momentum transfer are rigorous predictions of QCD, modulo calculable logarithmic corrections from the behavior of the hadronic wave functions at short distances. These anomalous-dimension corrections are determined by evolution equations for process-independent meson and baryon ""distribution amplitudes"" Ď(x<SUB>i</SUB>, Q) which control the valence-quark distributions in high-momentum-transfer exclusive reactions.

The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments.

443,"A rapid and accurate radiative transfer model (RRTM) for climate applications has been developed and the results extensively evaluated. The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10-3000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10-3000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) error of less than 1.0 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> at any altitude; 0.07 K d<SUP>-1</SUP> for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d<SUP>-1</SUP> in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>, an error of less than 5%. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.","Radiative transfer for inhomogeneous atmospheres: RRTM, a validated correlated-k model for the longwave"

By carrying out steepest-descent mappings of system configurations onto potential-energy minima, two main conclusions emerge: (1) a temperature-independent inherent structure underlies the liquid phase, just as for ``simple'' liquids with only pair interactions; (2) the Lindemann melting criterion for the crystal apparently can be supplemented by a freezing criterion for the liquid, where both involve critical values of appropriately defined mean displacements from potential minima.",Computer simulation of local order in condensed phases of silicon

The properties of these potentials are discussed in the context of earlier approaches, and their numerous recent successful applications are summarized. While the generation of these pseudopotentials from all-electron atom calculations is straightforward in principle, detailed consideration of the differences in physics of various groups of atoms is necessary to achieve pseudopotentials with the most desirable attributes. One important attribute developed here is optimum transferability to various systems. Another is the ability to be fitted with a small set of analytic functions useful with a variety of wave-function representations. On the basis of these considerations, a consistent set of pseudopotentials has been developed for the entire Periodic Table. Relativistic effects are included in a way that enables the potentials to be used in nonrelativistic formulations. The scheme used to generate the numerical potentials, the fitting procedure, and the testing of the fit are discussed. Representative examples of potentials are shown that display attributes spanning the set. A complete tabulation of the fitted potentials is given along with a guide to its use.",Pseudopotentials that work: From H to Pu

460,"Quantum computers promise to exceed the computational efficiency of ordinary classical machines because quantum algorithms allow the execution of certain tasks in fewer steps. But practical implementation of these machines poses a formidable challenge. Here I present a scheme for implementing a quantum-mechanical computer. Information is encoded onto the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon electronic devices. Logical operations on individual spins are performed using externally applied electric fields, and spin measurements are made using currents of spin-polarized electrons. The realization of such a computer is dependent on future refinements of conventional silicon electronics.",A silicon-based nuclear spin quantum computer
461,"This paper argues that the bridges and tails seen in some multiple galaxies are just tidal relics of close encounters. These consequences of the brief but violent tidal forces are here studied in a deliberately simple-minded fashion: Each encounter is considered to involve only two galaxies and to be roughly parabolic; each galaxy is idealized as just a disk of noninteracting test particles which initially orbit a central mass point. As shown here, the two-sided distortions provoked by gravity alone in such circumstances can indeed evolve kinematically into some remarkably narrow and elongated features: (i) After a relatively direct passage of a small companion, the outer portions of the primary disk often deform both into a near-side spiral arm or ""bridge"" extending toward this satellite, and into a far-side ""counterarm."" (ii) A similar encounter with an equal or more massive partner results typically in a long and curving ""tail"" of escaping debris from the far side of the victim disk, and in an avalanche of near-side particles, most of which are captured by the satellite. Besides extensive pictorial surveys of such tidal damage, this paper offers reconstructions of the orbits and outer shapes of four specific interacting pairs: Arp 295, M51 + NOC 5195, NGC 4676, and NOC 4038/9. Those models can be found in the fairly self-explanatory figures 19, 21, 22, and 23. Also discussed are some closely related issues of eccentric bound orbits, orbital decay, accretion, and forced spiral waves.",Galactic Bridges and Tails
462,"We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Î cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.","The many lives of active galactic nuclei: cooling flows, black holes and the luminosities and colours of galaxies"

By incorporating known corrections to the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation, one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS vacuum. Inclusion of a small number of D3Ě-branes in the resulting warped geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de Sitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is much greater than the cosmological time scale of 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr. We also prove, under certain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will always be shorter than the recurrence time.",de Sitter vacua in string theory
465,"The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.",The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter
466,"The magnetoelectric effect-the induction of magnetization by means of an electric field and induction of polarization by means of a magnetic field-was first presumed to exist by Pierre Curie, and subsequently attracted a great deal of interest in the 1960s and 1970s (refs 2-4). More recently, related studies on magnetic ferroelectrics have signalled a revival of interest in this phenomenon. From a technological point of view, the mutual control of electric and magnetic properties is an attractive possibility, but the number of candidate materials is limited and the effects are typically too small to be useful in applications. Here we report the discovery of ferroelectricity in a perovskite manganite, TbMnO<SUB>3</SUB>, where the effect of spin frustration causes sinusoidal antiferromagnetic ordering. The modulated magnetic structure is accompanied by a magnetoelastically induced lattice modulation, and with the emergence of a spontaneous polarization. In the magnetic ferroelectric TbMnO<SUB>3</SUB>, we found gigantic magnetoelectric and magnetocapacitance effects, which can be attributed to switching of the electric polarization induced by magnetic fields. Frustrated spin systems therefore provide a new area to search for magnetoelectric media.",Magnetic control of ferroelectric polarization

469,"This paper discusses some effects of mobile electrons in some antiferromagnetic lattices. It is shown that these electrons (or holes) always give rise to a distortion of the ground state spin arrangement, since electron transfer lowers the energy by a term of first order in the distortion angles. In the most typical cases this results in: (a) a nonzero spontaneous moment in low fields; (b) a lack of saturation in high fields; (c) simultaneous occurrence of ""ferromagnetic"" and ""antiferromagnetic"" lines in neutron diffraction patterns; (d) both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic branches in the spin wave spectra. Some of these properties have indeed been observed in compounds of mixed valency such as the manganites with low Mn<SUP>4+</SUP> content. Similar considerations apply at finite temperatures, at least for the (most widespread) case where only the bottom of the carrier band is occupied at all temperatures of interest. The free energy is computed by a variational procedure, using simple carrier wave functions and an extension of the molecular field approximation. It is found that the canted arrangements are stable up to a well-defined temperature T<SUB>1</SUB>. Above T<SUB>1</SUB> the system is either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, depending upon the relative amount of mobile electrons. This behavior is not qualitatively modified when the carriers which are responsible for double exchange fall into bound states around impurity ions of opposite charge. Such bound states, however, will give rise to local inhomogeneities in the spin distortion, and to diffuse magnetic peaks in the neutron diffraction pattern. The possibility of observing these peaks and of eliminating the spurious spin-wave scattering is discussed in an Appendix.",Effects of Double Exchange in Magnetic Crystals

472,"The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity.

474,"Analysis of the shape of the curve of reflected x-ray intensity vs glancing angle in the region of total reflection provides a new method of studying certain structural properties of the mirror surface about 10 to several hundred angstroms deep. Dispersion theory, extended to treat any (small) number of stratified homogeneous media, is used as a basis of interpretation. Curves for evaporated copper on glass at room temperature are studied as an example. These curves may be explained by assuming that the copper (exposed to atmospheric air at room temperature) has completely oxidized about 150A deep. If oxidation is less deep, there probably exists some general reduction of density (e.g., porosity) and an electron density minimum just below an internal oxide seal. This seal, about 25A below the nominal surface plane, arrests further oxidation of more deeply-lying loose-packed copper crystallites. All measurements to date have been carried out under laboratory atmospheric conditions which do not allow satisfactory separation or control of the physical and chemical variables involved in the surface peculiarities.

479,"It is extraordinary that a number of observations indicate that we live in a spatially flat, low matter density Universe, which is currently undergoing a period of accelerating expansion.

Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the /w=-1 or cosmological constant (/Λ) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at /w〈-1. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a ``phantom'' energy component which possesses an equation of state /w〈-1. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum.

481,"The study of the manganese oxides, widely known as manganites, that exhibit the âcolossalâ magnetoresistance effect is among the main areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons. After considerable theoretical effort in recent years, mainly guided by computational and mean-field studies of realistic models, considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties of these compounds. These recent studies suggest that the ground states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation, typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge and orbital ordered insulating domains. Calculations of the resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good agreement with experiments. The mixed-phase tendencies have two origins: (i) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters, and (ii) disorder-induced phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal-density phases, driven by disorder near first-order metal-insulator transitions. The coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer in size. It is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions. The main phenomenology of mixed-phase states appears to be independent of the fine details of the model employed, since the microscopic origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at the phenomenological level. However, it is quite important to clarify the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on microscopic Hamiltonians, including strong electron-phonon Jahn-Teller and/or Coulomb interactions. Thus, several issues are discussed here from the microscopic viewpoint as well, including the phase diagrams of manganite models, the stabilization of the charge/orbital/spin ordered half-doped correlated electronics (CE)-states, the importance of the naively small Heisenberg coupling among localized spins, the setup of accurate mean-field approximations, the existence of a new temperature scale T <SUP>â</SUP> where clusters start forming above the Curie temperature, the presence of stripes in the system, and many others. However, much work remains to be carried out, and a list of open questions is included here. It is also argued that the mixed-phase phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds as well, including ruthenates, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and others. It is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite important for progress in the field of correlated electrons.",Colossal magnetoresistant materials: the key role of phase separation

494,"A strong exchange field, such as produced by ferromagnetically aligned impurities in a metal, will tend to polarize the conduction electron spins. If the metal is a superconductor, this will happen only if the spin-exchange field is sufficiently strong compared to the energy gap. When the field is strong enough to break many electron pairs, the self-consistent gap equation is modified and a new type of depaired superconducting ground state occurs. In the idealization of a spatially uniform exchange field with no scattering, it is found that the depaired state has a spatially dependent complex Gorkov field, corresponding to a nonzero pairing momentum in the BCS model. The presence of the ""normal"" electrons from the broken pairs reduces the total current to zero, gives the depaired state some spin polarization, and results in almost normal Sommerfeld specific heat and single-electron tunneling characteristics. The nonzero value of the pairing momentum also gives rise to an unusual anisotropic electrodynamic behavior of the superconductor, as well as to a degenerate ground state and low-lying collective excitations, in accordance with Goldstone's theorem. The effects of scattering in an actual superconducting ferromagnetic alloy have not been studied and may interfere with experimental investigation of the theoretical results found in this paper for the idealized model.",Superconductivity in a Strong Spin-Exchange Field

If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result. If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three-element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or ``stored'' in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.",Dispersion and Absorption in Dielectrics I.

The contained fields may be either fermions or bosons and may have any spin; they may or may not be coupled to one another. Equations of motion and boundary conditions are obtained from a variational principle. The confining region has no dynamical freedom but constrains the fields inside: There are no excitations of the coordinates determining the confining region. The model possesses many desirable features of hadron dynamics: (i) a parton interpretation and presumably Bjorken scaling; the confined fields are free or weakly interacting except close to the boundary; (ii) infinitely rising Regge trajectories as a consequence of the bag's finite extent; (iii) the Hagedorn degeneracy or limiting temperature; (iv) all physical hadrons are singlets under hadronic gauge symmetries. For example, in a theory of fractionally charged, ""colored"" quarks interacting with colored, massless gauge vector gluons, if both quark and gluon fields are confined to the bag, only color-singlet solutions exist. In addition to establishing these general properties, we present complete classical and quantum solutions for free scalars and also for free fermions inside a bag of one space and one time dimension. Both systems have linear mass-squared spectra. We demonstrate PoincarĂŠ invariance at the classical level in any dimension and at the quantum level for the above-mentioned explicit solutions in two dimensions. We discuss the behavior of specific solutions in one and three space dimensions. We also discuss in detail the problem of fermion boundary conditions, which follow only indirectly from the variational principle.",New extended model of hadrons
497,"The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, ""atomic-like"" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.","X-Ray Interactions: Photoabsorption, Scattering, Transmission, and Reflection at E = 50-30,000 eV, Z = 1-92"

The potential has been fit directly to the Nijmegen $pp$ and $np$ scattering data base, low-energy $nn$ scattering parameters, and deuteron binding energy.

This review discusses several aspects of the cosmological constant both from the cosmological (Sections 1-6) and field theoretical (Sections 7-11) perspectives. After a brief introduction to the key issues related to cosmological constant and a historical overview, a summary of the kinematics and dynamics of the standard Friedmann model of the universe is provided. The observational evidence for cosmological constant, especially from the supernova results, and the constraints from the age of the universe, structure formation, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) anisotropies and a few others are described in detail, followed by a discussion of the theoretical models (quintessence, tachyonic scalar field, /...) from different perspectives. The latter part of the review (Sections 7-11) concentrates on more conceptual and fundamental aspects of the cosmological constant like some alternative interpretations of the cosmological constant, relaxation mechanisms to reduce the cosmological constant to the currently observed value, the geometrical structure of the de Sitter spacetime, thermodynamics of the de Sitter universe and the role of string theory in the cosmological constant problem.",Cosmological constant-the weight of the vacuum
501,We suggest and motivate a precise equivalence between uncompactified 11-dimensional M theory and the N=â limit of the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics describing D0 branes. The evidence for the conjecture consists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequence of supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe the properties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of the supergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading large distance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity. The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographic principle. The membrane states required by M theory are contained as excitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative geometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime.,M theory as a matrix model: A conjecture
502,"Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.",Partial-symmetries of weak interactions

505,"The usual interpretation of the quantum theory is self-consistent, but it involves an assumption that cannot be tested experimentally, viz., that the most complete possible specification of an individual system is in terms of a wave function that determines only probable results of actual measurement processes. The only way of investigating the truth of this assumption is by trying to find some other interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of at present ""hidden"" variables, which in principle determine the precise behavior of an individual system, but which are in practice averaged over in measurements of the types that can now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent paper, an interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of just such ""hidden"" variables is suggested. It is shown that as long as the mathematical theory retains its present general form, this suggested interpretation leads to precisely the same results for all physical processes as does the usual interpretation. Nevertheless, the suggested interpretation provides a broader conceptual framework than the usual interpretation, because it makes possible a precise and continuous description of all processes, even at the quantum level. This broader conceptual framework allows more general mathematical formulations of the theory than those allowed by the usual interpretation. Now, the usual mathematical formulation seems to lead to insoluble difficulties when it is extrapolated into the domain of distances of the order of 10<SUP>-13</SUP> cm or less. It is therefore entirely possible that the interpretation suggested here may be needed for the resolution of these difficulties. In any case, the mere possibility of such an interpretation proves that it is not necessary for us to give up a precise, rational, and objective description of individual systems at a quantum level of accuracy.","A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of ""Hidden"" Variables.

It is built out of quantum semiconductor structures that were grown by molecular beam epitaxy and designed by band structure engineering. Electrons streaming down a potential staircase sequentially emit photons at the steps. The steps consist of coupled quantum wells in which population inversion between discrete conduction band excited states is achieved by control of tunneling. A strong narrowing of the emission spectrum, above threshold, provides direct evidence of laser action at a wavelength of 4.2 micrometers with peak powers in excess of 8 milliwatts in pulsed operation.

511,"The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.",A unified theory of nuclear reactions.

The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M_V and mass-M_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M_V-(V-I), M_K-(I-K) and M_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T_eff ~ 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed.

The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters.

This is a high-frequency capacitance transient thermal scanning method useful for observing a wide variety of traps in semiconductors. The technique is capable of displaying the spectrum of traps in a crystal as positive and negative peaks on a flat baseline as a function of temperature. It is sensitive, rapid, and easy to analyze. The sign of the peak indicates whether the trap is near the conduction or valence band, the height of the peak is proportional to the trap concentration, and the position, in temperature, of the peak is uniquely determined by the thermal emission properties of the trap. In addition, one can measure the activation energy, concentration profile, and electron- and hole-capture cross sections for each trap. The technique is presented with a simple theoretical analysis for the case of exponential capacitance transients.

A large and anisotropic diamagnetic susceptibility is predicted for the conduction electrons; this is greatest for fields across the layers. The volume optical absorption is accounted for.",The Band Theory of Graphite

542,"Several improvements of the tetrahedron method for Brillouin-zone integrations are presented. (1) A translational grid of k points and tetrahedra is suggested that renders the results for insulators identical to those obtained with special-point methods with the same number of k points. (2) A simple correction formula goes beyond the linear approximation of matrix elements within the tetrahedra and also improves the results for metals significantly. For a required accuracy this reduces the number of k points by orders of magnitude. (3) Irreducible k points and tetrahedra are selected by a fully automated procedure, requiring as input only the space-group operations. (4) The integration is formulated as a weighted sum over irreducible k points with integration weights calculated using the tetrahedron method once for a given band structure. This allows an efficient use of the tetrahedron method also in plane-wave-based electronic-structure methods.",Improved tetrahedron method for Brillouin-zone integrations

547,"A description of normalized distributions (measures) lying upon possibly fractal sets is proposed, for example those arising in dynamical systems theory. The scaling properties of such measures are focused upon, by considering their singularities, which are characterized by two indices: alpha, which determines the strength of their singularities; and f, which describes how densely they are distributed. The spectrum of singularities is described by giving the possible range of alpha values and the function f(alpha). This formalism is applied to the 2 exp infinity cycle of period doubling, to the devil's staircase of mode locking, and to trajectories on 2-tori with golden-mean winding numbers. In all cases the new formalism allows an introduction of smooth functions to characterize the measures. It is believed that this formalism is readily applicable to experiments and should result in new tests of global universality.",Fractal measures and their singularities: The characterization of strange sets
548,"We recently proposed a solution to the hierarchy problem not relying on low-energy supersymmetry or technicolor. Instead, the problem is nullified by bringing quantum gravity down to the TeV scale. This is accomplished by the presence of n〉=2 new dimensions of submillimeter size, with the SM fields localized on a 3-brane in the higher dimensional space. In this paper we systematically study the experimental viability of this scenario. Constraints arise both from strong quantum gravitational effects at the TeV scale, and more importantly from the production of massless higher dimensional gravitons with TeV suppressed couplings. Theories with n〉2 are safe due mainly to the infrared softness of higher dimensional gravity. For n=2, the six dimensional Planck scale must be pushed above ~30 TeV to avoid cooling SN 1987A and distortions of the diffuse photon background. Nevertheless, the particular implementation of our framework within type I string theory can evade all constraints, for any n〉=2, with string scale m<SUB>s</SUB>~1 TeV. We also explore novel phenomena resulting from the existence of new states propagating in the higher dimensional space. The Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem is revived with a weak scale axion in the bulk. Gauge fields in the bulk can mediate repulsive forces ~10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> times stronger than gravity at submillimeter distances, as well as help stabilize the proton. Higher-dimensional gravitons produced on our brane and captured on a different ``fat'' brane can provide a natural dark matter candidate.","Phenomenology, astrophysics, and cosmology of theories with submillimeter dimensions and TeV scale quantum gravity"

553,"The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today, ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2Â° angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.",Angle-resolved photoemission studies of the cuprate superconductors

555,"Theoretical ideas and experimental results concerning high-temperature superconductors are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to calculations performed with the help of computers applied to models of strongly correlated electrons proposed to describe the two-dimensional CuO<SUB>2</SUB> planes. The review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the t-J model are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review, that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular, abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity Ď(Ď), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a d<SUB>x<SUP>2</SUP>-y<SUP>2</SUP></SUB> superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons are briefly discussed.",Correlated electrons in high-temperature superconductors
556,"Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H<SUB>0</SUB>. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H<SUB>0</SUB>. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei.

559,"Surface photometry shows that most spiral and S0 galaxies have two main components: a spheroidal component, and an exponential disk component with radial surface-brightness distribution 1(R) = Ioe 5. The exponential disk is the subject of this paper. First, for the exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium with surface density (R) = , we derive the circular-velocity field and the mass- angular momentum distribution (h); (h) is the total mass with angular momentum per unit mass less than h. (h) for the exponential disk is almost identical with (k) for a family of rigidly rotating spheres of uniform density. We then collect photometric data for the disks of thirty-six spiral and S0 galaxies, and find the following: (i) Twenty-eight of the thirty-six galaxies have approximately the same intensity scale 1o (21.65 B-mag per square second of arc), with a standard deviation of only 0.30 mag per square second of arc, despite a range of nearly 5 mag in absolute magnitude. This constancy of 1o produces the correlation between apparent magnitude and angular diameter found by Hubble. (ii) S0-Sbc systems have any value of the disk length scale between 1 and 5 kpc, while later-type systems have predominantly low values of a (ă2 kpc). (iii) The relative brightness and size of the spheroidal and disk components are only weakly with morphological type. If conclusion (i) implies that s is approximately constant, then the disk's total mass and angular momentum satisfy 7/4 If (h) is invariant as a protogalaxy collapses to form a galaxy, then all protogalaxies destined to be S0 or spiral galaxies have a similar (h) (in dimensionless variables), at least for the range of h corresponding to the disk. If (k) is not invariant, then there exists a very efficient mechanism which establishes the characteristic ) (h) for these systems as they form.

It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst.

564,"Intense ultrashort light pulses comprising merely a few wave cycles became routinely available by the turn of the millennium. The technologies underlying their production and measurement as well as relevant theoretical modeling have been reviewed in the pages of Reviews of Modern Physics (Brabec and Krausz, 2000). Since then, measurement and control of the subcycle field evolution of few-cycle light have opened the door to a radically new approach to exploring and controlling processes of the microcosm. The hyperfast-varying electric field of visible light permitted manipulation and tracking of the atomic-scale motion of electrons. Striking implications include controlled generation and measurement of single attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light as well as trains of them, and real-time observation of atomic-scale electron dynamics.

565,"Zener has suggested a type of interaction between the spins of magnetic ions which he named ""double exchange."" This occurs indirectly by means of spin coupling to mobile electrons which travel from one ion to the next. We have calculated this interaction for a pair of ions with general spin S and with general transfer integral, b, and internal exchange integral J. One result is that while the states of large total spin have both the highest and lowest energies, their average energy is the same as for the states of low total spin. This should be applicable in the high-temperature expansion of the susceptibility, and if it is, indicates that the high-temperature Curie-Weiss constant Î¸ should be zero, and 1Ď vs T a curved line. This is surprising in view of the fact that the manganites, in which double exchange has been presumed to be the interaction mechanism, obey a fairly good Curie-Weiss law. The results can be approximated rather well by a simple semiclassical model in which the spins of the ion cores are treated classically. This model is capable of rather easy extension to the problem of the whole crystal, but the resulting mathematical problem is not easily solved except in special circumstances, e.g., periodic disturbances (spin waves).",Considerations on Double Exchange

567,"The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard-Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair-correlation function) rather than the pair-correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard-Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments are discussed.",Role of Repulsive Forces in Determining the Equilibrium Structure of Simple Liquids

570,"The effects of thermal fluctuations, quenched disorder, and anisotropy on the phases and phase transitions in type-II superconductors are examined, focusing on linear and nonlinear transport properties. In zero magnetic field there are two crossovers upon approaching T<SUB>c</SUB>, first the ``Ginzburg'' crossover from mean-field behavior to the universality class of an uncharged superfluid, and then, much closer to T<SUB>c</SUB> for strongly type-II systems, a crossover to the universality class of a charged superfluid. The primary focus of this paper is on the behavior in the presence of a penetrating magnetic field. In a clean system the vortex-lattice phase can melt due to thermal fluctuations; we estimate the phase boundary in a variety of regimes. Pinning of vortices due to impurities or other defects destroys the long-range correlations of the vortex lattice, probably replacing it with a new vortex-glass phase that has spin-glasslike off-diagonal long-range order and is truly superconducting, in contrast to conventional theories of ``flux creep.'' The properties of this vortex-glass phase are examined, as well as the critical behavior near the transition from the vortex-glass to the vortex-fluid phase. The crossover from lattice to vortex-glass behavior for weak pinning is also examined. Linear and nonlinear conductivity measurements and other experiments on the high-T<SUB>c</SUB> superconductors Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O are discussed in light of the results.

571,"Examples of coupled irreversible processes like the thermoelectric phenomena, the transference phenomena in electrolytes and heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are considered. For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e.g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m.f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. (§§1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics (§3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. (§4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's ""principle of the least dissipation of energy"" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. (§5.) The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasi-thermodynamic theories is discussed. (§6.)

572,"Ultrahigh intensity lasers can potentially be used in conjunction with conventional fusion lasers to ignite inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsules with a total energy of a few tens of kilojoules of laser light, and can possibly lead to high gain with as little as 100 kJ. A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high-density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated material, as the critical density is pushed close to the high-density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high-intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high-density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh-intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel.",Ignition and high gain with ultrapowerful lasers*

580,"It is shown that the Hartree-Fock equations can be regarded as ordinary Schrรถdinger equations for the motion of electrons, each electron moving in a slightly different potential field, which is computed by electrostatics from all the charges of the system, positive and negative, corrected by the removal of an exchange charge, equal in magnitude to one electron, surrounding the electron whose motion is being investigated. By forming a weighted mean of the exchange charges, weighted and averaged over the various electronic wave functions at a given point of space, we set up an average potential field in which we can consider all of the electrons to move, thus leading to a great simplification of the Hartree-Fock method, and bringing it into agreement with the usual band picture of solids, in which all electron are assumed to move in the same field. We can further replace the average exchange charge by the corresponding value which we should have in a free-electron gas whose local density is equal to the density of actual charge at the position in question; this results in a very simple expression for the average potential field, which still behaves qualitatively like that of the Hartree-Fock method. This simplified field is being applied to problems in atomic structure, with satisfactory results, and is adapted as well to problems of molecules and solids.",A Simplification of the Hartree-Fock Method
581,"The theory of the kinetics of phase change is developed with the experimentally supported assumptions that the new phase is nucleated by germ nuclei which already exist in the old phase, and whose number can be altered by previous treatment. The density of germ nuclei diminishes through activation of some of them to become growth nuclei for grains of the new phase, and ingestion of others by these growing grains. The quantitative relations between the density of germ nuclei, growth nuclei, and transformed volume are derived and expressed in terms of a characteristic time scale for any given substance and process. The geometry and kinetics of a crystal aggregate are studied from this point of view, and it is shown that there is strong evidence of the existence, for any given substance, of an isokinetic range of temperatures and concentrations in which the characteristic kinetics of phase change remains the same. The determination of phase reaction kinetics is shown to depend upon the solution of a functional equation of a certain type. Some of the general properties of temperature-time and transformation-time curves, respectively, are described and explained.",Kinetics of Phase Change. I General Theory

The product of the electric and magnetic charges is a single Dirac unit, and the quantum of charge is that required by string duality. This is strong evidence that D-branes are intrinsic to type II string theory and are the Ramond-Ramond sources needed for string duality. Also, we find in the IIa string a 9-form potential, which gives an effective cosmological constant.",Dirichlet Branes and Ramond-Ramond Charges

To study this effect, the temperature dependence of the screening radius, as obtained from lattice QCD, is compared with the J/Ď radius calculated in charmomium models. The feasibility to detect this effect clearly in the dilepton mass spectrum is examined. It is concluded that J/Ď suppression in nuclear collisions should provide an unambiguous signature of quark-gluon plasma formation.",J/ψ suppression by quark-gluon plasma formation
585,"A new computational method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation is described. Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a correlation function 〈ψ( r, 0)| ψ( r, t)〉 from a numerical solution ψ( r, t). Fourier analysis of this correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Additional Fourier transforms of ψ( r, t) with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well potential and for the two-dimensional Hénon-Heiles potential.",Solution of the Schrödinger Equation by a Spectral Method

587,"We present a theory for tunneling between a real surface and a model probe tip, applicable to the recently developed ``scanning tunneling microscope.'' The tunneling current is found to be proportional to the local density of states of the surface, at the position of the tip. The effective lateral resolution is related to the tip radius R and the vacuum gap distance d approximately as [(2 Å)(R+d)]<SUP>1/2</SUP>. The theory is applied to the 2×1 and 3×1 reconstructions of Au(110); results for the respective corrugation amplitudes and for the gap distance are all in excellent agreement with experimental results of Binnig et al. if a 9-Å tip radius is assumed. In addition, a convenient approximate calculational method based on atom superposition is tested; it gives reasonable agreement with the self-consistent calculation and with experiment for Au(110). This method is used to test the structure sensitivity of the microscope. We conclude that for the Au(110) measurements the experimental ``image'' is relatively insensitive to the positions of atoms beyond the first atomic layer. Finally, tunneling to semiconductor surfaces is considered. Calculations for GaAs(110) illustrate interesting qualitative differences from tunneling to metal surfaces.",Theory of the scanning tunneling microscope

This confirms the concept of negative light pressure due to the gradient force. Trapping was observed over the entire range of particle size from 10 microns to about 25 nm in water. Use of the new trap extends the size range of macroscopic particles accessible to optical trapping and manipulation well into the Rayleigh size regime. Application of this trapping principle to atom trapping is considered.,Observation of a single-beam gradient force optical trap for dielectric particles
589,"Techniques that use quantum interference effects are being actively investigated to manipulate the optical properties of quantum systems. One such example is electromagnetically induced transparency, a quantum effect that permits the propagation of light pulses through an otherwise opaque medium. Here we report an experimental demonstration of electromagnetically induced transparency in an ultracold gas of sodium atoms, in which the optical pulses propagate at twenty million times slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. The gas is cooled to nanokelvin temperatures by laser and evaporative cooling. The quantum interference controlling the optical properties of the medium is set up by a `coupling' laser beam propagating at a right angle to the pulsed `probe' beam. At nanokelvin temperatures, the variation of refractive index with probe frequency can be made very steep. In conjunction with the high atomic density, this results in the exceptionally low light speeds observed. By cooling the cloud below the transition temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation (causing a macroscopic population of alkali atoms in the quantum ground state of the confining potential), we observe even lower pulse propagation velocities (17ms<SUP>-1</SUP>) owing to the increased atom density. We report an inferred nonlinear refractive index of 0.18cm<SUP>2</SUP>W<SUP>-1</SUP> and find that the system shows exceptionally large optical nonlinearities, which are of potential fundamental and technological interest for quantum optics.",Light speed reduction to 17 metres per second in an ultracold atomic gas

These boundary conditions are integrated with geophysical constraints in order to evaluate models for the development of the physical and chemical structure of the mantle. Data indicate that: (1) km-size heterogeneities can survive diffusive equilibrium for billions of years; (2) the mantle is chemically heterogeneous on both very small and very large scales; (3) isotopic heterogeneities in the mantle require the existence of four 'end-member' components (DMM, HIMU, EM I, and EM II) and are consistent with the existence of at least two additional components (BSE, PREMA); and (4) primitive undepleted mantle can made up no more than about 55 percent of the total mantle.",Chemical Geodynamics

592,"Based on the s-d interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c<SUP>1/5</SUP> and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.",Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys
593,"A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized ""optical"" potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.",Unified theory of nuclear reactions

Individual graphene layers are contacted with metal electrodes and patterned into ribbons of varying widths and different crystallographic orientations. The temperature dependent conductance measurements show larger energy gaps opening for narrower ribbons. The sizes of these energy gaps are investigated by measuring the conductance in the nonlinear response regime at low temperatures. We find that the energy gap scales inversely with the ribbon width, thus demonstrating the ability to engineer the band gap of graphene nanostructures by lithographic processes.",Energy Band-Gap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbons

Lyapunov exponents, which provide a qualitative and quantitative characterization of dynamical behavior, are related to the exponentially fast divergence or convergence of nearby orbits in phase space. A system with one or more positive Lyapunov exponents is defined to be chaotic. Our method is rooted conceptually in a previously developed technique that could only be applied to analytically defined model systems: we monitor the long-term growth rate of small volume elements in an attractor. The method is tested on model systems with known Lyapunov spectra, and applied to data for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction and Couette-Taylor flow.",Determining Lyapunov exponents from a time series

The models are spatially limited, corresponding to the tidal cutoff imposed by the Milky Way. Their projected density distributions are similar to those observed in open clusters, globular clusters, and elliptical galaxies. Within each model the fractional escape rate is uniform throughout. The escape rate from a cluster depends on the number of stars and the strength of the tidal force field; when expressed in this way it is almost independent of core radius or central concentration.

605,"Gold has suggested that pulsars are rotating magnetic neutron stars which formed in supernova explo- sions. We have investigated the simplest such model, one in which the magnetic dipole moment is aligned with the rotation axis. Our conclusions are as follows: In spite of its intense surface gravity, the star must possess a dense magnetosphere. The particles in the region threaded by those field lines which close within the light cylinder (of radius 5 X 1O~ p cm, where P sec is the stellar rotation period) rotate with the star. In the corotating zone the space-charge den- sity is 7 X 102 BZ/P electronic charges per cm3, where B~ (in gauss) is the component of magnetic field parallel to the rotation axis. The field lines which extend beyond the light cylinder close in a boundary zone near the supernova shell. Charged particles escape along these lines and are electrostatically accelerated up to energies of 3 X 1O'~ ZR63 B12 p-2 eV in the boundary zone. (Here, the stellar radius is R6 X 106 cm, and the magnetic field at the polar surface is B12 X 1012 gauss) Beyond the light cylinder the magnetic field becomes pre- dominantly toroidal. Its strength is 6 X 1O~ R63 B12 P~ ~ gauss at a distance of r~0 parsecs from the central star. The magnetic torque on the star causes its rotation period to lengthen at the rate P~ dP/dt = 10-8 B122 R64 p-2 M-' yr1 for an 211 solar-mass star. The rotational energy lost by the star is trans- ported out by the electromagnetic field and is then transmitted to the particles in the boundary zone.

606,"Sputtering of a target by energetic ions or recoil atoms is assumed to result from cascades of atomic collisions. The sputtering yield is calculated under the assumption of random slowing down in an infinite medium. An integrodifferential equation for the yield is developed from the general Boltzmann transport equation. Input quantities are the cross sections for ion-target and target-target collisions, and atomic binding energies. Solutions of the integral equation are given that are asymptotically exact in the limit of high ion energy as compared to atomic binding energies. Two main stages of the collision cascade have to be distinguished: first, the slowing down of the primary ion and all recoiling atoms that have comparable energies-these particles determine the spatial extent of the cascade; second, the creation and slowing down of low-energy recoils that constitute the major part of all atoms set in motion. The separation between the two stages is essentially complete in the limit of high ion energy, as far as the calculation of the sputtering yield is concerned. High-energy collisions are characterized by Thomas-Fermi-type cross sections, while a Born-Mayer-type cross section is applied in the low-energy region. Electronic stopping is included when necessary. The separation of the cascade into two distinct stages has the consequence that two characteristic depths are important for the qualitative understanding of the sputtering process. First, the scattering events that eventually lead to sputtering take place within a certain layer near the surface, the thickness of which depends on ion mass and energy and on ion-target geometry. In the elastic collision region, this thickness is a sizable fraction of the ion range. Second, the majority of sputtered particles originate from a very thin surface layer (~5 Ă), because small energies dominate. The general sputtering-yield formula is applied to specific situations that are of interest for comparison with experiment. These include backsputtering of thick targets by ion beams at perpendicular and oblique incidence and ion energies above ~100 eV, transmission sputtering of thin foils, sputtering by recoil atoms from Îą-active atoms distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously in a thick target, sputtering of fissionable specimens by fission fragments, and sputtering of specimens that are irradiated in the core of a reactor or bombarded with a neutron beam. There is good agreement with experimental results on polycrystalline targets within the estimated accuracy of the data and the input parameters entering the theory. There is no need for adjustable parameters in the usual sense, but specific experimental setups are discussed that allow independent checks or accurate determination of some input quantities.",Theory of Sputtering.

As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress-strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress-strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing.

622,"Recent research activities on the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effectâinduction of magnetization by an electric field or of polarization by a magnetic fieldâare reviewed. Beginning with a brief summary of the history of the ME effect since its prediction in 1894, the paper focuses on the present revival of the effect. Two major sources for 'large' ME effects are identified. (i) In composite materials the ME effect is generated as a product property of a magnetostrictive and a piezoelectric compound. A linear ME polarization is induced by a weak ac magnetic field oscillating in the presence of a strong dc bias field. The ME effect is large if the ME coefficient coupling the magnetic and electric fields is large. Experiments on sintered granular composites and on laminated layers of the constituents as well as theories on the interaction between the constituents are described. In the vicinity of electromechanical resonances a ME voltage coefficient of up to 90 V cm<SUP>-1</SUP> Oe<SUP>-1</SUP> is achieved, which exceeds the ME response of single-phase compounds by 3-5 orders of magnitude. Microwave devices, sensors, transducers and heterogeneous read/write devices are among the suggested technical implementations of the composite ME effect. (ii) In multiferroics the internal magnetic and/or electric fields are enhanced by the presence of multiple long-range ordering. The ME effect is strong enough to trigger magnetic or electrical phase transitions. ME effects in multiferroics are thus 'large' if the corresponding contribution to the free energy is large. Clamped ME switching of electrical and magnetic domains, ferroelectric reorientation induced by applied magnetic fields and induction of ferromagnetic ordering in applied electric fields were observed. Mechanisms favouring multiferroicity are summarized, and multiferroics in reduced dimensions are discussed. In addition to composites and multiferroics, novel and exotic manifestations of ME behaviour are investigated. This includes (i) optical second harmonic generation as a tool to study magnetic, electrical and ME properties in one setup and with access to domain structures; (ii) ME effects in colossal magnetoresistive manganites, superconductors and phosphates of the LiMPO<SUB>4</SUB> type; (iii) the concept of the toroidal moment as manifestation of a ME dipole moment; (iv) pronounced ME effects in photonic crystals with a possibility of electromagnetic unidirectionality. The review concludes with a summary and an outlook to the future development of magnetoelectrics research.",TOPICAL REVIEW:  Revival of the magnetoelectric effect

624,"The blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang has been transformed by the expansion of the Universe into the nearly isotropic 2.73K cosmic microwave background. Tiny inhomogeneities in the early Universe left their imprint on the microwave background in the form of small anisotropies in its temperature. These anisotropies contain information about basic cosmological parameters, particularly the total energy density and curvature of the Universe. Here we report the first images of resolved structure in the microwave background anisotropies over a significant part of the sky. Maps at four frequencies clearly distinguish the microwave background from foreground emission.

629,According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity requires the three-dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored on a two-dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two-dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three-dimensional phenomena. After outlining 't Hooft's proposal we give a preliminary informal description of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The consequences for high-energy particle collisions are described. The phenomenon of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have long been held by Charles Thorn.,The world as a hologram
630,"A formulation of numerical real-space renormalization groups for quantum many-body problems is presented and several algorithms utilizing this formulation are outlined. The methods are presented and demonstrated using S=1/2 and S=1 Heisenberg chains as test cases. The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10<SUP>-9</SUP>. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.",Density-matrix algorithms for quantum renormalization groups
631,"The reexamination of astrophysical opacities has eliminated gross discrepancies between a variety of observations and theoretical calculations; thus allowing for more detailed tests of stellar models. A number of such studies indicate that model results are sensitive to modest changes in the opacity. Consequently, it is desirable to update available opacity databases with recent improvements in physics, refinements of element abundance, and other such factors affecting the results. Updated OPAL Rosseland mean opacities are presented. The new results have incorporated improvements in the physics and numerical procedures as well as corrections. The main opacity changes are increases of as much as 20% for Population I stars due to the explicit inclusion of 19 metals (compared to 12 metals in the earlier calculations) with the other modifications introducing opacity changes smaller than 10%. In addition, the temperature and density range covered by the updated opacity tables has been extended. As before, the tables allow accurate interpolation in density and temperature as well as hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and metal mass fractions. Although a specific metal composition is emphasized, opacity tables for different metal distributions can be made readily available.

637,,New Magnetic Anisotropy
638,"The use of individual molecules as functional electronic devices was first proposed in the 1970s (ref. 1). Since then, molecular electronics, has attracted much interest, particularly because it could lead to conceptually new miniaturization strategies in the electronics and computer industry. The realization of single-molecule devices has remained challenging, largely owing to difficulties in achieving electrical contact to individual molecules. Recent advances in nanotechnology, however, have resulted in electrical measurements on single molecules. Here we report the fabrication of a field-effect transistor-a three-terminal switching device-that consists of one semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotube, connected to two metal electrodes. By applying a voltage to a gate electrode, the nanotube can be switched from a conducting to an insulating state. We have previously reported similar behaviour for a metallic single-wall carbon nanotube operated at extremely low temperatures. The present device, in contrast, operates at room temperature, thereby meeting an important requirement for potential practical applications. Electrical measurements on the nanotube transistor indicate that its operation characteristics can be qualitatively described by the semiclassical band-bending models currently used for traditional semiconductor devices. The fabrication of the three-terminal switching device at the level of a single molecule represents an important step towards molecular electronics.",Room-temperature transistor based on a single carbon nanotube
639,"A general procedure for computing monochromatic light curves of close eclipsing-binary systems is presented, with allowance for rotational and tidal distortion, the reflection effect, limb darkening, and gravity darkening. All basic techniques used to compute light curves are specified. Solution of the inverse problem (finding the elements from observations) is accomplished by differential corrections, and probable errors are obtained for all adjustable parameters. No rectification of any kind is used or needed. Because of the basic flexibility of the scheme, present limitations (e.g., synchronous rotation only, black- body physics) may be improved upon with reasonable convenience, as time permits. The procedure has been applied to B and V observations of MR Cyg, and the results of the differential corrections adjustments are given. With the use of available spectroscopic observations and model-atmosphere results by Mihalas, the components are placed in the H-R diagram. Although the primary seems to be on the main sequence, the secondary is found to be above the main sequence an observation which suggests that the secondary may still be in the gravitational-con traction phase.",Realization of Accurate Close-Binary Light Curves: Application to MR Cygni
640,"This article reviews the physics of high-temperature superconductors from the point of view of the doping of a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Andersonâs idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d -wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high- T<SUB>c</SUB> cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed.

Also, the spectra are distributed on the stellar evolutionary tracks using optical/near-infrared color calibrations, as an improvement over models that used a single color of the effective temperature of the stars alone.

For dilatation symmetric quantum theories realistic asymptotic cosmology is obtained provided the effective potential has a nontrivial minimum.

657,"We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus-nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au + Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark-gluon matter has been produced at RHIC.",Experimental and theoretical challenges in the search for the quark-gluon plasma: The STAR Collaboration's critical assessment of the evidence from RHIC collisions

Merritt & Ferrarese have argued that low slopes (〈~4) arise because of neglect of random measurement errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations and several others account for at most a small part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese & Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r<SUB>e</SUB>/8 (r<SUB>e</SUB> is the effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements.

660,"The manner in which states of some quantum systems become effectively classical is of great significance for the foundations of quantum physics, as well as for problems of practical interest such as quantum engineering. In the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that many (perhaps all) of the symptoms of classicality can be induced in quantum systems by their environments. Thus decoherence is caused by the interaction in which the environment in effect monitors certain observables of the system, destroying coherence between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly nonlocal “Schrödinger-cat states.” The classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit. Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation. Only the preferred pointer observable of the apparatus can store information that has predictive power. When the measured quantum system is microscopic and isolated, this restriction on the predictive utility of its correlations with the macroscopic apparatus results in the effective “collapse of the wave packet.” The existential interpretation implied by einselection regards observers as open quantum systems, distinguished only by their ability to acquire, store, and process information. Spreading of the correlations with the effectively classical pointer states throughout the environment allows one to understand “classical reality” as a property based on the relatively objective existence of the einselected states. Effectively classical pointer states can be “found out” without being re-prepared, e.g, by intercepting the information already present in the environment. The redundancy of the records of pointer states in the environment (which can be thought of as their “fitness” in the Darwinian sense) is a measure of their classicality. A new symmetry appears in this setting. Environment-assisted invariance or envariance sheds new light on the nature of ignorance of the state of the system due to quantum correlations with the environment and leads to Born’s rules and to reduced density matrices, ultimately justifying basic principles of the program of decoherence and einselection.","Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical"

The HITRAN compilation consists of several components that serve as input for radiative-transfer calculation codes: individual line parameters for the microwave through visible spectra of molecules in the gas phase; absorption cross-sections for molecules having dense spectral features, i.e. spectra in which the individual lines are not resolved; individual line parameters and absorption cross-sections for bands in the ultraviolet; refractive indices of aerosols, tables and files of general properties associated with the database; and database management software. The line-by-line portion of the database contains spectroscopic parameters for 42 molecules including many of their isotopologues.",The HITRAN 2008 molecular spectroscopic database
666,"We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.",A Line-of-Sight Integration Approach to Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies

668,"We present a large grid of stellar evolutionary tracks, which are suitable to modelling star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis. The tracks are presented for the initial chemical compositions [Z=0.0004, Y=0.23], [Z=0.001, Y=0.23], [Z=0.004, Y=0.24], [Z=0.008, Y=0.25], [Z=0.019, Y=0.273] (solar composition), and [Z=0.03, Y=0.30]. They are computed with updated opacities and equation of state, and a moderate amount of convective overshoot. The range of initial masses goes from 0.15 M<SUB>sun</SUB> to 7 M<SUB>sun</SUB>, and the evolutionary phases extend from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) till either the thermally pulsing AGB regime or carbon ignition.

We study whether these processes wash out the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) generated at some earlier state (say, at GUT temperatures). We also discuss the possibility of BAU generation by the electroweak processes themselves and find that this does not take place if the electroweak phase transition is of second order.

673,"In 1978 it was discovered, largely through the work of Fleischmann, Van Duyne, Creighton, and their coworkers that molecules adsorbed on specially prepared silver surfaces produce a Raman spectrum that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected. This effect was dubbed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Since then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules and with a number of metals, including Cu, Ag, Au, Li, Na, K, In, Pt, and Rh. In addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence have been observed. Although not all fine points of the enhancement mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest contributor to the intensity amplification results from the electric field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting metal particles that are illuminated with light resonant or near resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal structure. Small in this context is gauged in relation to the wavelength of light. The special preparations required to produce the effect, which include among other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating rough films (as in the case of the former two examples) or by placing small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the case of the latter two). For molecules chemisorbed on SERS-active surface there exists a ""chemical enhancement"" in addition to the electromagnetic effect. Although difficult to measure accurately, the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is best thought to arise from the modification of the Raman polarizability tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex between the adsorbate and the metal. Rather than an enhancement mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as a change in the nature and identity of the adsorbate.",Surface-enhanced spectroscopy
674,"The described investigation is concerned with the solution of the non-LTE optically thick transfer equations for hydrogen, carbon, and other constituents to determine semiempirical models for six components of the quiet solar chromosphere. For a given temperature-height distribution, the solution is obtained of the equations of statistical equilibrium, radiative transfer for lines and continua, and hydrostatic equilibrium to find the ionization and excitation conditions for each atomic constituent. The emergent spectrum is calculated, and a trial and error approach is used to adjust the temperature distribution so that the emergent spectrum is in best agreement with the observed one. The relationship between semiempirical models determined in this way and theoretical models based on radiative equilibrium is discussed by Avrett (1977).

In this review, I update the census of Local Group dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium (ISM), (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the ""dark matter problem"" and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing, and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and still do not know about these nearby dwarfs.

678,"A weekly 1° spatial resolution optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis has been produced at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using both in situ and satellite data from November 1981 to the present. The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly 0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5°C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1° grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05°C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large. However, smaller unexplained differences also occur in other regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere where in situ data should be adequate.",An Improved In Situ and Satellite SST Analysis for Climate.

But this dominance is now being challenged by the emergence of a new generation of photovoltaic cells, based, for example, on nanocrystalline materials and conducting polymer films. These offer the prospect of cheap fabrication together with other attractive features, such as flexibility. The phenomenal recent progress in fabricating and characterizing nanocrystalline materials has opened up whole new vistas of opportunity. Contrary to expectation, some of the new devices have strikingly high conversion efficiencies, which compete with those of conventional devices.

681,"Extensions of percolation theory to treat transport are described. Resistor networks, from which resistors are removed at random, provide the natural generalization of the lattice models for which percolation thresholds and percolation probabilities have previously been considered. The normalized conductance, G, of such networks proves to be a sharply defined quantity with a characteristic concentration dependence near threshold which appears sensitive only to dimensionality. Numerical results are presented for several families of 3D and 2D network models. Except close to threshold, the models based on bond percolation are accurately described by a simple effective medium theory, which can also treat continuous media or situations less drastic than the percolation models, for example, materials in which local conductivity has a continuous distribution of values. The present calculations provide the first quantitative test of this theory. A ""Green's function"" derivation of the effective medium theory, which makes contact with similar treatments of disordered alloys, is presented. Finally, a general expression for the conductance of a percolation model is obtained which relates G to the spin-stiffness coefficient, D, of an appropriately defined model dilute ferromagnet. We use this relationship to argue that the ""percolation channels"" through which the current flows above threshold must be regarded as three dimensional.",Percolation and Conduction
682,"We consider the dynamical consequences of Biermann's suggestion that gas is often streaming outward in all directions from the sun with velocities of the order of 500-1500 km/sec. These velocities of 500 km/sec and more and the interplanetary densities of 500 ions/cm3 (1014 gm/sec mass loss from the sun) follow from the hydrodynamic equations for a 3 X 1060 K solar corona. It is suggested that the outward-streaming gas draws out the lines of force of the solar magnetic fields so that near the sun the field is very nearly in a radial direction.

Our results are compared with previous data. In general, there is good agreement among optical parameters measured on smooth, clean, and undamaged samples maintained in an inert atmosphere regardless of the technique used to obtain the data.

687,"Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a different way. It is, however, mathematically equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of â) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function Ď(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.",Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
688,"Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.",Three qubits can be entangled in two inequivalent ways
689,"Polarity discontinuities at the interfaces between different crystalline materials (heterointerfaces) can lead to nontrivial local atomic and electronic structure, owing to the presence of dangling bonds and incomplete atomic coordinations. These discontinuities often arise in naturally layered oxide structures, such as the superconducting copper oxides and ferroelectric titanates, as well as in artificial thin film oxide heterostructures such as manganite tunnel junctions. If polarity discontinuities can be atomically controlled, unusual charge states that are inaccessible in bulk materials could be realized. Here we have examined a model interface between two insulating perovskite oxides-LaAlO<SUB>3</SUB> and SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>-in which we control the termination layer at the interface on an atomic scale. In the simple ionic limit, this interface presents an extra half electron or hole per two-dimensional unit cell, depending on the structure of the interface.

690,"The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy γ-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 × 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy γ-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic γ-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.",The Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Mission

In this manner we obtain finite, purely imaginary values for the actions of the Kerr-Newman solutions and de Sitter space. One interpretation of these values is that they give the probabilities for finding such metrics in the vacuum state. Another interpretation is that they give the contribution of that metric to the partition function for a grand canonical ensemble at a certain temperature, angular momentum, and charge. We use this approach to evaluate the entropy of these metrics and find that it is always equal to one quarter the area of the event horizon in fundamental units. This agrees with previous derivations by completely different methods.

696,"An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing ℏ k--〉 by the operator p--〉-eA--〉c. The resultant Schrödinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of ""rational"" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an ""irrational"" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic ""superlattice"" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched.",Energy levels and wave functions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields
697,"The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z〉~2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3〈~z〈~3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2〈~z〈~4.5. While none of the ~60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0〈~z〈~1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6〈~z〈~3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe.

At 〈z〉=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is ~=3 times lower than the 〈z〉=2.75 value.

700,"Following an historical introduction, the conventional canonical formulation of general relativity theory is presented. The canonical Lagrangian is expressed in terms of the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures of the hypersurface x<SUP>0</SUP>=constant, and its relation to the asymptotic field energy in an infinite world is noted. The distinction between finite and infinite worlds is emphasized. In the quantum theory the primary and secondary constraints become conditions on the state vector, and in the case of finite worlds these conditions alone govern the dynamics. A resolution of the factor-ordering problem is proposed, and the consistency of the constraints is demonstrated. A 6-dimensional hyperbolic Riemannian manifold is introduced which takes for its metric the coefficient of the momenta in the Hamiltonian constraint. The geodesic incompletability of this manifold, owing to the existence of a frontier of infinite curvature, is demonstrated. The possibility is explored of relating this manifold to an infinite-dimensional manifold of 3-geometries, and of relating the structure of the latter manifold in turn to the dynamical behavior of space-time. The problem is approached through the WKB approximation and Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Einstein's equations are revealed as geodesic equations in the manifold of 3-geometries, modified by the presence of a ""force term."" The classical phenomenon of gravitational collapse shows that the force term is not powerful enough to prevent the trajectory of space-time from running into the frontier. The as-yet unresolved problem of determining when the collapse phenomenon represents a real barrier to the quantum-state functional is briefly discussed, and a boundary condition at the barrier is proposed. The state functional of a finite world can depend only on the 3-geometry of the hypersurface x<SUP>0</SUP>=constant. The label x<SUP>0</SUP> itself is irrelevant, and ""time"" must be determined intrinsically. A natural definition for the inner product of two such state functionals is introduced which, however, encounters difficulties with negative probabilities owing to the barrier boundary condition. In order to resolve these difficulties, a simplified model, the quantized Friedmann universe, is studied in detail. In order to obtain nonstatic wave functions which resemble a universe evolving, it is necessary to introduce a clock. In order that the combined wave functions of universe-cum-clock be normalizable, it turns out that the periods of universe and clock must be commensurable. Wave packets exhibiting quasiclassical behavior are constructed, and attention is called to the phenomenological character of ""time."" The innerproduct definition is rescued from its negative-probability difficulties by making use of the fact that probability flows in a closed finite circuit in configuration space. The article ends with some speculations on the uniqueness of the state functional of the actual universe. It is suggested that a viewpoint due to Everett should be adopted in its interpretation.",Quantum Theory of Gravity. I. The Canonical Theory
701,"We report the discovery of antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling and enhanced saturation magnetoresistance in two new metallic superlattice systems, Co/Cr and Co/Ru. In these systems and in Fe/Cr superlattices both the magnitude of the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling and the saturation magnetoresistance are found to oscillate with the Cr or Ru spacer layer thickness with a period ranging from 12 Ă in Co/Ru to ~=18-21 Ă in the Fe/Cr and Co/Cr systems.","Oscillations in exchange coupling and magnetoresistance in metallic superlattice structures: Co/Ru, Co/Cr, and Fe/Cr"
702,"A new internally contracted direct multiconfiguration-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) method is described which allows the use of much larger reference spaces than any previous MRCI method. The configurations with two electrons in the external orbital space are generated by applying pair excitation operators to the reference wave function as a whole, while the singly external and internal configurations are standard uncontracted spin eigenfunctions. A new efficient and simple method for the calculation of the coupling coefficients is used, which is well suited for vector machines, and allows the recalculation of all coupling coefficients each time they are needed. The vector Hâc is computed partly in a nonorthogonal configuration basis. In order to test the accuracy of the internally contracted wave functions, benchmark calculations have been performed for F<SUP>-</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, NH<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>, OH, NO, N<SUB>2</SUB>, and O<SUB>2</SUB> at various geometries. The deviations of the energies obtained with internally contracted and uncontracted MRCI wave functions are mostly smaller than 1 mH and typically 3-5 times smaller than the deviations between the uncontracted MRCI and the full CI. Dipole moments, electric dipole polarizabilities, and electronic dipole transition moments calculated with uncontracted and contracted MRCI wave functions also are found to be in close agreement. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in large scale calculations for the CN, NH<SUB>3</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and Cr<SUB>2</SUB> molecules. In these calculations up to 3088 reference configurations and up to 154 orbitals were employed.

706,"In this paper is described a model for polaron motion which incorporates, in simplified form, the principal physical features of the problem. The (crystalline) medium, within which a single excess electron (or hole) is contained, is taken to be a one-dimensional molecular crystal, consisting of diatomic molecular sites; each site possesses a single vibrational degree of freedom, represented by the deviation, x<SUB>n</SUB>, of its internuclear separation from equilibrium. The motion of the electron in this medium is treated by a tight-binding approach, in which the wave function is represented as a superposition of local ""molecular"" functions, Ď(r - na, x<SUB>n</SUB>). In line with the x<SUB>n</SUB> dependence of the Î´'s, it is also assumed that the ""local"" electronic energy, E <SUB>n</SUB>, (which, in the conventional tight-binding theory, has one and the same value for all sites) depends (linearly) on x<SUB>n</SUB>. This dependence gives rise to electron-lattice interaction; alternatively, it may be regarded as removing the electronic translational degeneracy, characteristic of the undistorted crystal, and thereby providing the possibility for electron trapping. On the basis of the above-described model, the zeroth order adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem is developed. For values of the parameters such that the linear dimension of the polaron is large compared to a lattice spacing (""large"" polaron), an exact solution is obtained; the correspondence between it and Pekar's zeroth-order solution is established. The conditions under which the size of the polaron becomes comparable to a lattice spacing (""small"" polaron) are discussed. Finally, by way of exhibiting the relationship of the molecular-crystal concept to the real situation, a description is given of an alternate molecular-crystal model which, in the case of the large polaron, is completely equivalent to the continuum-polarization model of conventional polaron theory.",Studies of polaron motion : Part I.

As an example, we show that a Higgs type of Lagrangian allows for vortex-line solutions, in analogy with the vortex lines in a type II superconductor. These vortex lines can approximately be identified with the Nambu string. In the strong coupling limit we speculate that the vortex lines make up all low energy phenomena. It turns out that this strong coupling limit is ""super quantum mechanical"" in the sense that the typical action of the theory is very small in comparison with Plank's constant.",Vortex-line models for dual strings
709,"The stability of a plane current layer is analyzed in the hydromagnetic approximation, allowing for finite isotropic resistivity. The effect of a small layer curvature is simulated by a gravitational field. In an incompressible fluid, there can be three basic types of ``resistive'' instability: a long-wave ``tearing'' mode, corresponding to breakup of the layer along current-flow lines; a short-wave ``rippling'' mode, due to the flow of current across the resistivity gradients of the layer; and a low-g gravitational interchange mode that grows in spite of finite magnetic shear. The time scale is set by the resistive diffusion time τ<SUB>R</SUB> and the hydromagnetic transit time τ<SUB>H</SUB> of the layer. For large S = τ<SUB>R</SUB>/τ<SUB>H</SUB>, the growth rate of the ``tearing'' and ``rippling'' modes is of order τ<SUB>R</SUB><SUP>-3/5</SUP>τ<SUB>H</SUB><SUP>-2/5</SUP>, and that of the gravitational mode is of order τ<SUB>R</SUB><SUP>-1/3</SUP>τ<SUB>H</SUB><SUP>-2/3</SUP>. As S → ∞, the gravitational effect dominates and may be used to stabilize the two nongravitational modes. If the zero-order configuration is in equilibrium, there are no overstable modes in the incompressible case. Allowance for plasma compressibility somewhat modifies the ``rippling'' and gravitational modes, and may permit overstable modes to appear. The existence of overstable modes depends also on increasingly large zero-order resistivity gradients as S → ∞. The three unstable modes merely require increasingly large gradients of the first-order fluid velocity; but even so, the hydromagnetic approximation breaks down as S → ∞. Allowance for isotropic viscosity increases the effective mass density of the fluid, and the growth rates of the ``tearing'' and ``rippling'' modes then scale as τ<SUB>R</SUB><SUP>-2/3</SUP>τ<SUB>H</SUB><SUP>-1/3</SUP>. In plasmas, allowance for thermal conductivity suppresses the ``rippling'' mode at moderately high values of S. The ``tearing'' mode can be stabilized by conducting walls. The transition from the low-g ``resistive'' gravitational mode to the familiar high-g infinite conductivity mode is examined. The extension of the stability analysis to cylindrical geometry is discussed. The relevance of the theory to the results of various plasma experiments is pointed out. A nonhydromagnetic treatment will be needed to achieve rigorous correspondence to the experimental conditions.",Finite-Resistivity Instabilities of a Sheet Pinch
710,"Ab initio effective core potentials (ECP's) have been generated to replace the Coulomb, exchange, and core-orthogonality effects of the chemically inert core electron in the transition metal atoms Sc to Hg. For the second and third transition series relative ECP's have been generated which also incorporate the mass-velocity and Darwin relativistic effects into the potential. The ab initio ECP's should facilitate valence electron calculations on molecules containing transition-metal atoms with accuracies approaching all-electron calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. Analytic fits to the potentials are presented for use in multicenter integral evaluation. Gaussian orbital valence basis sets are developed for the (3d,4s,4p), (4d,5s,5p), and (5d,6s,6p) orbitals of the first, second, and third transition series atoms, respectively. All-electron and valence-electron atomic excitation energies are also compared for the low-lying states of Sc-Hg, and the valence-electron calculations are found to reproduce the all-electron excitation energies (typically within a few tenths of an eV).",Ab initio effective core potentials for molecular calculations.

711,"The (U, V, W)-velocity vectors for 221 well-observed dwarf stars have been used to compute the eccentricities and angular momenta of the galactic orbits in a model galaxy. It is shown that the eccentricity and the observed ultraviolet excess are strongly correlated. The stars with the largest excess (i.e., lowest metal abundance) are invariably moving in highly elliptical orbits, whereas stars with little or no excess move in nearly circular orbits. Correlations also exist between the ultraviolet excess and the W-velocity. Finally, the excess and the angnlar momentum are correlated; stars with large ultraviolet excesses have small angular momenta. These correlations are discussed in terms of the dynamics of a collapsing galaxy. The data require that the oldest stars were formed out of gas falling toward the galactic center in the radial direction and collapsing from the halo onto the plane. The collapse was very rapid and only a few times 108 years were required for the gas to attain circular orbits in equilibrium (i e., gravitational attraction balanced by centrifugal acceleration). The scale of the collapse is tentatively estimated to be at least 10 in the radial direction and 25 in the Z-direction. The initial contraction must have begun near the time of formation of the first stars, some 1010 years ago.",Evidence from the motions of old stars that the Galaxy collapsed.
712,"Based on a first-principles approach, we present scaling rules for the band gaps of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) as a function of their widths. The GNRs considered have either armchair or zigzag shaped edges on both sides with hydrogen passivation. Both varieties of ribbons are shown to have band gaps. This differs from the results of simple tight-binding calculations or solutions of the Diracâs equation based on them. Our ab initio calculations show that the origin of energy gaps for GNRs with armchair shaped edges arises from both quantum confinement and the crucial effect of the edges. For GNRs with zigzag shaped edges, gaps appear because of a staggered sublattice potential on the hexagonal lattice due to edge magnetization. The rich gap structure for ribbons with armchair shaped edges is further obtained analytically including edge effects. These results reproduce our ab initio calculation results very well.",Energy Gaps in Graphene Nanoribbons

714,"According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of numerous satellites of different sizes and masses. This ongoing process is not 100% efficient in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of M31. Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (V<SUB>circ</SUB>) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc assuming the Hubble constant1 h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n(〉V<SUB>circ</SUB>)~55+/-11(V<SUB>circ</SUB>/10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1.4+/-0.4</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> for V<SUB>circ</SUB> in the range ~10-70 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n(〉V<SUB>circ</SUB>)~1200(V<SUB>circ</SUB>/10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-2.75</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and mass greater than 3×10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict ~300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only ~40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at ~50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with V<SUB>circ</SUB>〉~50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.",Where Are the Missing Galactic Satellites?
715,"The individual spins of the Ising model are assumed to interact with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit. Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.",Time-Dependent Statistics of the Ising Model

Our model shows that knowledge of the unconditional mass function alone is sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the large-scale bias factor. We then use the mass function measured in numerical simulations of SCDM, OCDM and LambdaCDM to compute this bias. Comparison with these simulations shows that this simple way of estimating the bias relation and its evolution is accurate for less massive haloes as well as massive ones.

Images of the infrared galaxies show that nearly all are strongly interacting merger systems with exceptionally luminous nuclei.

Optical spectra indicate a mixture of starburst and active galactic nucleus (AGN) energy sources, both of which are apparently fueled by the tremendous reservoir of molecular gas. It is proposed that these ultraluminous infrared galaxies represent the initial, dust- enshrouded stages of quasars. Once these nuclei shed their obscuring dust, allowing the AGN to visually dominate the decaying starburst, they become optically selected quasars. The origin of quasars through the merger of molecular gas-rich spiral galaxies can account for both the increased number of high-luminosity quasars at large redshift, when the universe was smaller and gas supplies less depleted, and the observed ""redshift-cutoff"" of quasars which represents the epoch after galaxy formation when the first collisions occur.",Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies and the Origin of Quasars

Examples of active flexible applications include paper displays and wearable computers. So far, mainly flexible devices based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and organic semiconductors have been investigated. However, the performance of these devices has been insufficient for use as transistors in practical computers and current-driven organic light-emitting diode displays. Fabricating high-performance devices is challenging, owing to a trade-off between processing temperature and device performance. Here, we propose to solve this problem by using a novel semiconducting material-namely, a transparent amorphous oxide semiconductor from the In-Ga-Zn-O system (a-IGZO)-for the active channel in transparent thin-film transistors (TTFTs).

Despite being only one atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (πα = 2.3%) fraction of incident white light, a consequence of graphene’s unique electronic structure.",Fine Structure Constant Defines Visual Transparency of Graphene
739,"We examine the properties of the host galaxies of 22 623 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with 0.02 〈 z 〈 0.3 selected from a complete sample of 122 808 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.",The host galaxies of active galactic nuclei
740,"Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between ""strong"" and ""fragile,"" and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d〈r^2〉/dT(〈r^2〉 is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes (""bosons""), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature T_K, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.",Formation of Glasses from Liquids and Biopolymers

742,"Resonance properties are investigated within the QCD-based approach to resonance physics developed earlier. We extend first the dispersion charmonium theory to include power terms due to the non-perturbative effects of QCD. As a byproduct, an estimate for the gluonic vacuum expectation value, 〈0| G<SUB>μν</SUB><SUP>a</SUP>G<SUB>μν</SUB><SUP>a</SUP>|0〉, emerges. The main emphasis is made on the analysis of the ϱ, ω, ϕ, K <SUP>∗</SUP> mesons.

It is shown that there exist such M<SUP>2</SUP> that the integrals are dominated by a single resonance, on one hand, and are calculable in a reliable way, on the other. As a result we are able to calculate the resonance coupling constants and masses. The typical accuracy achieved is about 10%.

743,"We give a classical confidence belt construction which unifies the treatment of upper confidence limits for null results and two-sided confidence intervals for non-null results. The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice is based on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battleground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.",Unified approach to the classical statistical analysis of small signals

The effect is much stronger than the usual anisotropic magnetoresistance and further increases in structures with more than two Fe layers. It can be explained in terms of spin-flip scattering of conduction electrons caused by the antiparallel alignment of the magnetization.,Enhanced magnetoresistance in layered magnetic structures with antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange

A homogenized system is proposed, based on the systems of Glass (1984) and Johnson et al. (1966). The homogenized data sets are used to derive intrinsic colors for a number of giants and dwarfs. The passbands of several IR systems are estimated and the synthetic colors of the systems are compared using blackbody and stellar fluxes. The passbands were adjusted in wavelength to produce agreement with observed relations between different systems, making it possible to estimate the effective wavelengths of the different natural systems.","JHKLM Photometry: Standard Systems, Passbands, and Intrinsic Colors"
747,"RECENT results<SUP>1,2</SUP> from two ice cores drilled in central Greenland have revealed large, abrupt climate changes of at least regional extent during the late stages of the last glaciation, suggesting that climate in the North Atlantic region is able to reorganize itself rapidly, perhaps even within a few decades. Here we present a detailed stable-isotope record for the full length of the Greenland Ice-core Project Summit ice core, extending over the past 250 kyr according to a calculated timescale. We find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper<SUP>3</SUP>) and during the previous Saale-Holstein glacial cycle. This is in contrast with the extreme stability of the Holocene, suggesting that recent climate stability may be the exception rather than the rule. The last interglacial seems to have lasted longer than is implied by the deep-sea SPECMAP record<SUP>4</SUP>, in agreement with other land-based observations<SUP>5,6</SUP>. We suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the Saalean ice sheets in America and Eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy.",Evidence for general instability of past climate from a 250-kyr ice-core record

After presenting the basic formalism for these calculations we discuss in detail the effective Hamiltonians of all decays for which the next-to-leading-order corrections are known. Subsequently, we present the phenomenological implications of these calculations. The values of various parameters are updated, in particular the mass of the newly discovered top quark. One of the central issues in this review are the theoretical uncertainties related to renormalization-scale ambiguities, which are substantially reduced by including next-to-leading-order corrections.

750,"The Solar Oscillations Investigation (SOI) uses the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument to probe the interior of the Sun by measuring the photospheric manifestations of solar oscillations. Characteristics of the modes reveal the static and dynamic properties of the convection zone and core. Knowledge of these properties will improve our understanding of the solar cycle and of stellar evolution. Other photospheric observations will contribute to our knowledge of the solar magnetic field and surface motions. The investigation consists of coordinated efforts by several teams pursuing specific scientific objectives. The instrument images the Sun on a 1024<SUP>2</SUP> CCD camera through a series of increasingly narrow spectral filters. The final elements, a pair of tunable Michelson interferometers, enable MDI to record filtergrams with a FWHM bandwidth of 94 mÅ. Normally 20 images centered at 5 wavelengths near the Ni I 6768 spectral line are recorded each minute. MDI calculates velocity and continuum intensity from the filtergrams with a resolution of 4″ over the whole disk. An extensive calibration program has verified the end-to-end performance of the instrument. To provide continuous observations of the longest-lived modes that reveal the internal structure of the Sun, a carefully-selected set of spatial averages are computed and downlinked at all times. About half the time MDI will also be able to downlink complete velocity and intensity images each minute. This high rate telemetry (HRT) coverage is available for at least a continuous 60-day interval each year and for 8 hours each day during the rest of the year. During the 8-hour HRT intervals, 10 of the exposures each minute can be programmed for other observations, such as measurements in MDI's higher resolution (1.25″) field centered about 160″ north of the equator; meanwhile, the continuous structure program proceeds during the other half minute. Several times each day, polarizers will be inserted to measure the line-of-sight magnetic field. MDI operations will be scheduled well in advance and will vary only during the daily 8-hour campaigns. Quick-look and summary data, including magnetograms, will be processed immediately. Most high-rate data will be delivered only by mail to the SOI Science Support Center (SSSC) at Stanford, where a processing pipeline will produce 3 Terabytes of calibrated data products each year. These data products will be analyzed using the SSSC and the distributed resources of the co-investigators.

This process can be tedious and is often done manually, since available commercial or in-house software usually can do only part of the job.To expedite this process, we introduce the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), which is a free, public domain software package that can be used to manipulate columns of tabular data, time series, and gridded data sets and to display these data in a variety of forms ranging from simple x-y plots to maps and color, perspective, and shaded-relief illustrations. GMT uses the PostScript page description language, which can create arbitrarily complex images in gray tones or 24-bit true color by superimposing multiple plot files. Line drawings, bitmapped images, and text can be easily combined in one illustration. PostScript plot files are device-independent, meaning the same file can be printed at 300 dots per inch (dpi) on an ordinary laserwriter or at 2470 dpi on a phototypesetter when ultimate quality is needed. GMT software is written as a set of UNIX tools and is totally self contained and fully documented.

763,"The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C<SUB>6</SUB> coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.",A consistent and accurate ab initio parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 elements H-Pu

Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.",A new method of determining distances to galaxies.

768,"A sufficiently fine ferromagnetic particle has a uniform vector magnetization whose magnitude is essentially constant, but whose direction fluctuates because of thermal agitation. The fluctuations are important in superparamagnetism and in magnetic aftereffect. The problem is approached here by methods familiar in the theory of stochastic processes. The ""Langevin equation"" of the problem is assumed to be Gilbert's equation of motion augmented by a ""random-field"" term. Consideration of a statistical ensemble of such particles leads to a ""Fokker-Planck"" partial differential equation, which describes the evolution of the probability density of orientations. The random-field concept, though convenient, can be avoided by use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The Fokker-Planck equation, in general, is complicated by the presence of gyroscopic terms. These drop out in the case of axial symmetry: then the problem of finding nonequilibrium solutions can be restated as a minimization problem, susceptible to approximate treatments. The case of energy barriers large in comparison with kT is treated both by approximate minimization and by an adaptation of Kramers' treatment of the escape of particles over barriers. The limits of validity of the discrete-orientation approximation are discussed.",Thermal Fluctuations of a Single-Domain Particle
769,"It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.",The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis
770,"Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei.

For those cases in which conformal invariance is broken only by mass terms, the formalism automatically gives results that are invariant under electric-magnetic duality. In one instance, this duality is mixed in an interesting way with SO(8) triality.","Monopoles, duality and chiral symmetry breaking in N = 2 supersymmetric QCD"
772,"It is shown that the close connection between event horizons and thermodynamics which has been found in the case of black holes can be extended to cosmological models with a repulsive cosmological constant. An observer in these models will have an event horizon whose area can be interpreted as the entropy or lack of information of the observer about the regions which he cannot see. Associated with the event horizon is a surface gravity Îş which enters a classical ""first law of event horizons"" in a manner similar to that in which temperature occurs in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that this similarity is more than an analogy: An observer with a particle detector will indeed observe a background of thermal radiation coming apparently from the cosmological event horizon. If the observer absorbs some of this radiation, he will gain energy and entropy at the expense of the region beyond his ken and the event horizon will shrink. The derivation of these results involves abandoning the idea that particles should be defined in an observer-independent manner. They also suggest that one has to use something like the Everett-Wheeler interpretation of quantum mechanics because the back reaction and hence the spacetime metric itself appear to be observer-dependent, if one assumes, as seems reasonable, that the detection of a particle is accompanied by a change in the gravitational field.","Cosmological event horizons, thermodynamics, and particle creation"
773,"The ultimate fate of the Universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can be determined by using the redshifts and distances of very distant supernovae to monitor changes in the expansion rate. We can now find large numbers of these distant supernovae, and measure their redshifts and apparent brightnesses; moreover, recent studies of nearby type Ia supernovae have shown how to determine their intrinsic luminosities-and therefore with their apparent brightnesses obtain their distances. The ă50 distant supernovae discovered so far provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over the past several billion years. However, it is necessary to extend this expansion history still farther away (hence further back in time) in order to begin to distinguish the causes of the expansion-rate changes-such as the slowing caused by the gravitational attraction of the Universe's mass density, and the possibly counteracting effect of the cosmological constant. Here we report the most distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. Spectra and photometry from the largest telescopes on the ground and in space show that this ancient supernova is strikingly similar to nearby, recent type Ia supernovae. When combined with previous measurements of nearer supernovae,, these new measurements suggest that we may live in a low-mass-density universe.",Discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the Universe

785,"Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200^circC. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into ""ropes,"" which consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms.

The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of ă10<SUP>-4</SUP> ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge, where growth occurs. These factors strongly favor the metallic (10, 10) tube with C<SUB>5v</SUB> symmetry and an open edge stabilized by triple bonds.",Crystalline Ropes of Metallic Carbon Nanotubes

791,"Finite graphite systems having a zigzag edge exhibit a special edge state. The corresponding energy bands are almost flat at the Fermi level and thereby give a sharp peak in the density of states. The charge density in the edge state is strongly localized on the zigzag edge sites. No such localized state appears in graphite systems having an armchair edge. By utilizing the graphene ribbon model, we discuss the effect of the system size and edge shape on the special edge state. By varying the width of the graphene ribbons, we find that the nanometer size effect is crucial for determining the relative importance of the edge state. We also have extended the graphene ribbon to have edges of a general shape, which is defined as a mixture of zigzag and armchair sites. Examining the relative importance of the edge state for graphene ribbons with general edges, we find that a non-negligible edge state survives even in graphene ribbons with less developed zigzag edges. We demonstrate that such an edge shape with three or four zigzag sites per sequence is sufficient to show an edge state, when the system size is on a nanometer scale. The special characteristics of the edge state play a large role in determining the density of states near the Fermi level for graphite networks on a nanometer scale.",Edge state in graphene ribbons: Nanometer size effect and edge shape dependence
792,"The evolution of discs under the action of viscosity is studied by both similarity solutions and Green's functions. The angular momentum is steadily concentrated onto a small fraction of the mass which orbits at greater and greater radii while the rest is accreted onto the central body. We assume that the angular momentum excess of a proto-star is initially concentrated onto one-third of the total mass which forms a disc orbiting the new-born star. Viscous dissipation in this disc will cause it to shine with a luminosity greater than the final main sequence star for a period of io yr or so. Most of the properties of T Tauri stars can be explained as a consequence of disc evolution. Flares in Flare stars are interpreted as the entry of blobs of an old disc into the late type stellar atmospheres. On this hypothesis flaring activity could be observed in M stars of up to 5 x io yr old, and planetary systems will be common. Disc solutions appropriate to dwarf novae and X-ray sources are also given.",The evolution of viscous discs and the origin of the nebular variables.

We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline.

The potential function is based on Tersoff's covalent-bonding formalism with additional terms that correct for an inherent overbinding of radicals and that include nonlocal effects. Atomization energies for a wide range of hydrocarbon molecules predicted by the potential compare well to experimental values. The potential correctly predicts that the Ď-bonded chain reconstruction is the most stable reconstruction on the diamond \{111\} surface, and that hydrogen adsorption on a bulk-terminated surface is more stable than the reconstruction. Predicted energetics for the dimer reconstructed diamond \{100\} surface as well as hydrogen abstraction and chemisorption of small molecules on the diamond \{111\} surface are also given.

The major uncertainties in accretion disk theory are the dissipation process (viscosity) and the emission process. It is noted that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for almost any combination of viscosity and radiation processes, the possibilities are almost endless. Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by observation and subsequent modeling than by pure theorizing.",Accretion discs in astrophysics
802,"Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state - supercooling - has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.",Supercooled liquids and the glass transition

807,"We present a first-principles theory of the quasiparticle energies in semiconductors and insulators described in terms of the electron self-energy operator. The full dielectric matrix is used to evaluate the self-energy operator in the GW approximation: the first term in an expansion of the self-energy operator in terms of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction (W) and the dressed Green's function (G). Quasiparticle energies are calculated for the homopolar materials diamond, Si, and Ge as well as for the ionic compound LiCl. The results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. In particular, the indirect band gap is calculated as 5.5, 1.29, and 0.75 eV as compared with experimental gaps of 5.48, 1.17, and 0.744 eV for diamond, Si, and Ge, respectively. The Ge results include relativistic effects. The calculated direct gap for LiCl is within 5% of experiment. Viewed as a correction to the density-functional eigenvalues calculated with the local-density approximation, the present results show a correction dominated by a large jump at the gap. It is found that because of the charge inhomogeneity, the full dielectric screening matrix must be included, i.e., local-field effects are essential. The dynamical effects are also found to be crucial. The required dielectric matrices are obtained within the density-functional approach for the static case and extended to finite frequency with use of a generalized plasmon-pole model based on sum rules. The model reproduces the Ď and Ď<SUP>-1</SUP> moments of the exact many-body response function. The qualitative features of the electron self-energy operator are discussed. Using the static Coulomb-hole-screened-exchange approximation for illustration, the role of local fields in the self-energy operator are explained.

The same qualitative features are observed in both the homopolar and ionic materials.",Electron correlation in semiconductors and insulators: Band gaps and quasiparticle energies
808,"Quantum-state engineering, i.e., active control over the coherent dynamics of suitable quantum-mechanical systems, has become a fascinating prospect of modern physics. With concepts developed in atomic and molecular physics and in the context of NMR, the field has been stimulated further by the perspectives of quantum computation and communication. Low-capacitance Josephson tunneling junctions offer a promising way to realize quantum bits (qubits) for quantum information processing. The article reviews the properties of these devices and the practical and fundamental obstacles to their use. Two kinds of device have been proposed, based on either charge or phase (flux) degrees of freedom. Single- and two-qubit quantum manipulations can be controlled by gate voltages in one case and by magnetic fields in the other case. Both kinds of device can be fabricated with present technology. In flux qubit devices, an important milestone, the observation of superpositions of different flux states in the system eigenstates, has been achieved. The Josephson charge qubit has even demonstrated coherent superpositions of states readable in the time domain. There are two major problems that must be solved before these devices can be used for quantum information processing. One must have a long phase coherence time, which requires that external sources of dephasing be minimized. The review discusses relevant parameters and provides estimates of the decoherence time. Another problem is in the readout of the final state of the system. This issue is illustrated with a possible realization by a single-electron transistor capacitively coupled to the Josephson device, but general properties of measuring devices are also discussed. Finally, the review describes how the basic physical manipulations on an ideal device can be combined to perform useful operations.",Quantum-state engineering with Josephson-junction devices
809,"We describe an ab initio method for calculating the electronic structure, electronic transport, and forces acting on the atoms, for atomic scale systems connected to semi-infinite electrodes and with an applied voltage bias. Our method is based on the density-functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the well tested SIESTA approach (which uses nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the effect of the core electrons, and linear combination of finite-range numerical atomic orbitals to describe the valence states). We fully deal with the atomistic structure of the whole system, treating both the contact and the electrodes on the same footing. The effect of the finite bias (including self-consistency and the solution of the electrostatic problem) is taken into account using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We relate the nonequilibrium Green's function expressions to the more transparent scheme involving the scattering states. As an illustration, the method is applied to three systems where we are able to compare our results to earlier ab initio DFT calculations or experiments, and we point out differences between this method and existing schemes.

The phenomenon is discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro-physics but direct tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved impossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple condensed-matter experiment using electrostatic barriers in single- and bi-layer graphene.

All of the FIRST data raw visibilities, self-calibrated UV data sets, individual pointing maps, final merged images, source catalogs, and individual source images are being placed in the public domain as soon as they are verified; all of the 1993 data are now available through the NRAO and/or the STScI archive. We conclude with a brief summary of the scientific significance of FIRST, which represents an improvement by a factor of 50 in both angular resolution and sensitivity over the best available large area radio surveys.",The FIRST Survey: Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters

Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in $\sim 20\%$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation.

By choosing a specific model for the dissipative interaction of the system of interest with its environment, we are able to evaluate the influence functional in closed form and express it in terms of a few parameters such as the phenomenological viscosity coefficient. We show that in the limit h→0 the results obtained from the influence functional formalism reduce to the classical Fokker-Planck equation. In the case of a simple harmonic oscillator with arbitrarily strong damping and at arbitrary temperature, we obtain an explicit expression for the time evolution of the complete density matrix ϱ( x, x′, t) when the system starts in a particular kind of pure state.

833,"An extended basis set of atomic functions expressed as fixed linear combinations of Gaussian functions is presented for hydrogen and the first-row atoms carbon to fluorine. In this set, described as 4-31 G, each inner shell is represented by a single basis function taken as a sum of four Gaussians and each valence orbital is split into inner and outer parts described by three and one Gaussian function, respectively. The expansion coefficients and Gaussian exponents are determined by minimizing the total calculated energy of the atomic ground state. This basis set is then used in single-determinant molecular-orbital studies of a group of small polyatomic molecules. Optimization of valence-shell scaling factors shows that considerable rescaling of atomic functions occurs in molecules, the largest effects being observed for hydrogen and carbon. However, the range of optimum scale factors for each atom is small enough to allow the selection of a standard molecular set. The use of this standard basis gives theoretical equilibrium geometries in reasonable agreement with experiment.",Self-Consistent Molecular-Orbital Methods. IX.

834,"The system of strongly interacting particles is discussed, with electromagnetism, weak interactions, and gravitation considered as perturbations. The electric current j<SUB>α</SUB>, the weak current J<SUB>α</SUB>, and the gravitational tensor θ<SUB>αβ</SUB> are all well-defined operators, with finite matrix elements obeying dispersion relations. To the extent that the dispersion relations for matrix elements of these operators between the vacuum and other states are highly convergent and dominated by contributions from intermediate one-meson states, we have relations like the Goldberger-Treiman formula and universality principles like that of Sakurai according to which the ρ meson is coupled approximately to the isotopic spin. Homogeneous linear dispersion relations, even without subtractions, do not suffice to fix the scale of these matrix elements; in particular, for the nonconserved currents, the renormalization factors cannot be calculated, and the universality of strength of the weak interactions is undefined. More information than just the dispersion relations must be supplied, for example, by field-theoretic models; we consider, in fact, the equal-time commutation relations of the various parts of j<SUB>4</SUB> and J<SUB>4</SUB>. These nonlinear relations define an algebraic system (or a group) that underlies the structure of baryons and mesons. It is suggested that the group is in fact U(3)×U(3), exemplified by the symmetrical Sakata model. The Hamiltonian density θ<SUB>44</SUB> is not completely invariant under the group; the noninvariant part transforms according to a particular representation of the group; it is possible that this information also is given correctly by the symmetrical Sakata model. Various exact relations among form factors follow from the algebraic structure. In addition, it may be worthwhile to consider the approximate situation in which the strangeness-changing vector currents are conserved and the Hamiltonian is invariant under U(3); we refer to this limiting case as ""unitary symmetry."" In the limit, the baryons and mesons form degenerate supermultiplets, which break up into isotopic multiplets when the symmetry-breaking term in the Hamiltonian is ""turned on."" The mesons are expected to form unitary singlets and octets; each octet breaks up into a triplet, a singlet, and a pair of strange doublets. The known pseudoscalar and vector mesons fit this pattern if there exists also an isotopic singlet pseudoscalar meson χ<SUP>0</SUP>. If we consider unitary symmetry in the abstract rather than in connection with a field theory, then we find, as an attractive alternative to the Sakata model, the scheme of Ne'eman and Gell-Mann, which we call the ""eightfold way"" the baryons N, Λ, Σ, and Ξ form an octet, like the vector and pseudoscalar meson octets, in the limit of unitary symmetry. Although the violations of unitary symmetry must be quite large, there is some hope of relating certain violations to others.

837,"We study dark matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution N-body simulation of a ΛCDM cosmology. Our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloes in the range 10<SUP>11</SUP>-10<SUP>14</SUP>h<SUP>-1</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and the resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles are parametrized by an NFW form with two parameters, an inner radius r<SUB>s</SUB> and a virial radius R<SUB>vir</SUB>, and we define the halo concentration c<SUB>vir</SUB>≡R<SUB>vir</SUB>r<SUB>s</SUB>. First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is c<SUB>vir</SUB>~(1+z)<SUP>-1</SUP>. This corresponds to r<SUB>s</SUB>(z)~constant, and is contrary to earlier suspicions that c<SUB>vir</SUB> does not vary much with redshift. The implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1σ Δ(logc<SUB>vir</SUB>)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of ΔV<SUB>max</SUB>V<SUB>max</SUB>=0.12. We discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger scatter. These results suggest that c<SUB>vir</SUB> is an essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of galaxy formation.","Profiles of dark haloes: evolution, scatter and environment"
838,"Numerical assessments of global air quality and potential changes in atmospheric chemical constituents require estimates of the surface fluxes of a variety of trace gas species. We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5Â°Ă0.5Â° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5% other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of all global natural VOC emissions. Croplands, shrublands and other woodlands contribute 10-20% apiece. Isoprene emissions calculated for temperate regions are as much as a factor of 5 higher than previous estimates.",A global model of natural volatile organic compound emissions

840,"Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M<SUB>â</SUB>. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.",Embedded Clusters in Molecular Clouds

The imperfections of invisibility can be made arbitrarily small to hide objects that are much larger than the wavelength. With the use of modern metamaterials, practical demonstrations of such devices may be possible.

843,"Recent observations suggest that a large fraction of the energy density of the Universe has negative pressure. One explanation is vacuum energy density; another is quintessence in the form of a scalar field slowly evolving down a potential. In either case, a key problem is to explain why the energy density nearly coincides with the matter density today. The densities decrease at different rates as the Universe expands, so coincidence today appears to require that their ratio be set to a specific, infinitesimal value in the early Universe. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a ``tracker field,'' a form of quintessence, and show how it may explain the coincidence, adding new motivation for the quintessence scenario.","Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant"

846,"If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal ""K profile parameterization"" (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R<SUB>Ď</SUB>. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.",Oceanic vertical mixing: A review and a model with a nonlocal boundary layer parameterization

We present a review of this development focusing on shot noise in small electric conductors. Shot noise is a consequence of the quantization of charge. It can be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided. We conclude the review by pointing out a number of unsolved problems and an outlook on the likely future development of the field.",Shot noise in mesoscopic conductors
848,"In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.",Energy input from quasars regulates the growth and activity of black holes and their host galaxies

851,"When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary.

Bulk Bi<SUB>1-x</SUB>Sb<SUB>x</SUB> single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator.

We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity.

866,"We analyze pairing of fermions in two dimensions for fully gapped cases with broken parity (P) and time reversal (T), especially cases in which the gap function is an orbital angular momentum (l) eigenstate, in particular l=-1 (p wave, spinless, or spin triplet) and l=-2 (d wave, spin singlet). For lâ 0, these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair wave function that is asympototically the same as that in the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge states, quasihole, and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating that nonabelian statistics is a generic property of such a paired phase. The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the Haldane-Rezayi state is not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian phase, which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken U(1) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem, the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero tunneling there is a transition to the Moore-Read phase. The effects of disorder on noninteracting quasiparticles are considered. The gapped phases survive, but there is an intermediate thermally conducting phase in the spinless p-wave case, in which the quasiparticles are extended.",Paired states of fermions in two dimensions with breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries and the fractional quantum Hall effect

868,"We present an analytical description of the merging of virialized haloes which is applicable to any hierarchical model in which structure grows via gravitational instability. The formulae are an extension of the Press-Schechter model. The dependence of the merger rate on halo mass, epoch, the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and the density parameter {OMEGA}_0_ is explicitly quantified. We calculate the distribution of halo formation limes and survival times. We also describe a Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to formation of haloes of a prescribed mass. Applying these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, we infer that a high value of the density parameter ({OMEGA}_0_ ă~ 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit significant substructure, if such substructure only persists for a time 0.2t_0_ after a merger, where t_0_ is the present age of the universe. We also investigate the rate of infall of satellite galaxies into galactic discs, by combining our Monte Carlo technique for halo mergers with an estimate of the time required for dynamical friction to erode the orbits of the baryonic cores the accreted galaxies. We find that, even for {OMEGA}_0_ = 1, the infall rate is low(provided that the satellite orbits are not too eccentric), and that we would expect only a fraction of stellar discs to be thickened or disrupted by this process.",Merger rates in hierarchical models of galaxy formation

871,"A rigorous QCD analysis of the inclusive annihilation decay rates of heavy quarkonium states is presented. The effective-field-theory framework of nonrelativistic QCD is used to separate the short-distance scale of annihilation, which is set by the heavy quark mass M, from the longer-distance scales associated with quarkonium structure. The annihilation decay rates are expressed in terms of nonperturbative matrix elements of four-fermion operators in nonrelativistic QCD, with coefficients that can be computed using perturbation theory in the coupling constant Îą<SUB>s</SUB>(M). The matrix elements are organized into a hierarchy according to their scaling with v, the typical velocity of the heavy quark.

874,,The Effects of Shape on the Interaction of Colloidal Particles
875,"In regular crystals, the width of the absorption lines arising from the magnetic moment of the electron or nucleus is caused primarily by the interaction between the magnetic dipoles. It is prohibitively difficult to determine the precise shape of the absorption line theoretically, but the invariance of the diagonal sum in quantum mechanics permits the calculation of the second moment of the frequency deviation, and hence the r.m.s. line breadth. The latter agrees excellently with the observations of Pake and Purcell on the magnetic absorption of the F nucleus in CaF<SUB>2</SUB>, both in absolute magnitude, and in the dependence on the direction between the magnetic field and the principal cubic axes. The fourth moment was also computed to examine how good an approximation is the conventional assumption of a Gaussian shape. As long as no exchange is present (the nuclear case) the Gaussian model is moderately good. For the 100 direction in a cubic crystal, the theoretical ratio of root mean fourth to root mean square breadth is 1.25. Pake and Purcell's measurements yield 1.24. A Gaussian model would require 1.32. The theory is extended to include crystals with two kinds of spin moments (two types of nuclei, or simultaneous nuclear and electronic spin). Coupling between unlike moments is less effective (by a factor 2/3 in the r.m.s. width) than that between like in broadening the lines. In the paramagnetic absorption caused by electronic spin, it is imperative to include the effect of exchange coupling. This interaction does not contribute to the second moment, but greatly increases the fourth. As a result, the lines are peaked much more sharply than one would compute from the second moment with the Gaussian model for line shape. This ""exchange narrowing"" explains why microwave paramagnetic absorption lines are much narrower than one first conjectures from the amount of dipolar coupling. The theoretical calculations are given in Sections II-IV. The final sections V-VI give the comparison with the experiments of Pake and Purcell, and with the model of Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound, for r-f absorption in liquids.",The Dipolar Broadening of Magnetic Resonance Lines in Crystals

The black hole may be a consequence of neutron star merger or neutron star-black hole merger, but for long complex bursts, it is more likely to come from the collapse of a single Wolf-Rayet star endowed with rotation ('failed' Type Ib supernova). The disk is geometrically thick and typically has a mass inside 100 km of several tenths of a solar mass. In the failed supernova case, the disk is fed for a longer period of time by the collapsing star. At its inner edge the disk is thick to its own neutrino emission and evolves on a viscous time scale of several seconds. In a region roughly 30 km across, interior to the accretion disk and along its axis of rotation, a pair fireball is generated by neutrino annihilation and electron-neutrino scattering which deposit approximately 10 exp 50 ergs/s.",Gamma-Ray Bursts from Stellar Mass Accretion Disks around Black Holes

883,"Several consequences are derived for a neutron star whose magnetic moment tends to be antiparallel to its spin angular momentum, when emitted electrons do not return to the star through the light cylinder along the open field lines. A polar magnetospheric gap is formed that spans the open field lines from the stellar surface up to an altitude of about 10,000 cm. The scalar product of the electric and magnetic fields is nonzero in the gap, although it vanishes essentially everywhere else in the near magnetosphere. The potential difference between the base and the top of the gap is about 1 trillion volts. The gap continually breaks down by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds. The gap positrons move out along the open field lines and electrons flow to the stellar surface to close the pulsar's homopolar generator circuit. The proposed model can explain many characteristics of the coherent microwave radiation observed from pulsars.","Theory of pulsars: polar gaps, sparks, and coherent microwave radiation."

886,"Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.","Instability, turbulence, and enhanced transport in accretion disks"

Limiting cases of the plasma diffuse field coupling are calculated, and the resulting cooling functions are presented.

889,"If two separated observers are supplied with entanglement, in the form of n pairs of particles in identical partly entangled pure states, one member of each pair being given to each observer, they can, by local actions of each observer, concentrate this entanglement into a smaller number of maximally entangled pairs of particles, for example, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen singlets, similarly shared between the two observers. The concentration process asymptotically conserves entropy of entanglement-the von Neumann entropy of the partial density matrix seen by either observer-with the yield of singlets approaching, for large n, the base-2 entropy of entanglement of the initial partly entangled pure state. Conversely, any pure or mixed entangled state of two systems can be produced by two classically communicating separated observers, drawing on a supply of singlets as their sole source of entanglement.",Concentrating partial entanglement by local operations
890,"The rise time of intense radiation determines the maximum field strength atoms can be exposed to before their polarizability dramatically drops due to the detachment of an outer electron. Recent progress in ultrafast optics has allowed the generation of ultraintense light pulses comprising merely a few field oscillation cycles. The arising intensity gradient allows electrons to survive in their bound atomic state up to external field strengths many times higher than the binding Coulomb field and gives rise to ionization rates comparable to the light frequency, resulting in a significant extension of the frontiers of nonlinear optics and (nonrelativistic) high-field physics. Implications include the generation of coherent harmonic radiation up to kiloelectronvolt photon energies and control of the atomic dipole moment on a subfemtosecond (1 fs=10<SUP>-15</SUP> s) time scale. This review presents the landmarks of the 30-odd-year evolution of ultrashort-pulse laser physics and technology culminating in the generation of intense few-cycle light pulses and discusses the impact of these pulses on high-field physics. Particular emphasis is placed on high-order harmonic emission and single subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet/x-ray pulse generation. These as well as other strong-field processes are governed directly by the electric-field evolution, and hence their full control requires access to the (absolute) phase of the light carrier.

892,"In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic-isobaric, canonical, and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects.

897,"Neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic dipole fields B_dipole ~ 10^14 - 10^15 G, can form when conditions for efficient helical dynamo action are met during the first few seconds after gravitational collapse. Such high-field neutron stars, ""magnetars,"" initially rotate with short periods ~ 1 ms, but quickly lose most of their rotational energy via magnetic braking, giving a large energy boost to the associated supernova explosion. Several mechanisms unique to magnetars can plausibly generate large (~ 1000 km/s) recoil velocities. These include anisotropic neutrino emission, core rotational instability and fragmentation, and/or anisotropic magnetic winds. Magnetars are relatively difficult to detect because they drop below the radio death line faster than ordinary pulsars, and because they probably do not remain bound in binary systems. We conjecture that their main observational signature is gamma-ray bursts powered by their vast reservoirs of magnetic energy. If they acquire large recoils, most magnetars are unbound from the Galaxy or reside in an extended, weakly bound Galactic corona. There is evidence that the soft gamma repeaters are young magnetars.

899,"The current understanding of the behavior of quantum chromodynamics at finite temperature is presented. Perturbative methods are used to explore the high-temperature dynamics. At sufficiently high temperatures the plasma of thermal excitations screens all color electric fields and quarks are unconfined. It is believed that the high-temperature theory develops a dynamical mass gap. However in perturbation theory the infrared behavior of magnetic fluctuations is so singular that beyond some order the perturbative expansion breaks down. The topological classification of finite-energy, periodic fields is presented and the classical solutions which minimize the action in each topological sector are examined. These include periodic instantons and magnetic monopoles. At sufficiently high temperature only fields with integral topological charge can contribute to the functional integral. Electric screening completely suppresses the contribution of fields with nonintegral topological charge. Consequently the Î¸ dependence of the free energy at high temperature is dominated by the contribution of instantons. The complete temperature dependence of the instanton density is explicitly computed and large-scale instantons are found to be suppressed. Therefore the effects of instantons may be reliably calculated at sufficiently high temperature. The behavior of the theory in the vicinity of the transition from the high-temperature quark phase to the low-temperature hadronic phase cannot be accurately computed. However, at least in the absence of light quarks, semiclassical techniques and lattice methods may be combined to yield a simple picture of the dynamics valid for both high and low temperature, and to estimate the transition temperature.",QCD and instantons at finite temperature

Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be -1 to -2 watts per square meter, globally averaged. This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign. Thus, the aerosol forcing has likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree. However, differences in geographical and seasonal distributions of these forcings preclude any simple compensation. Aerosol effects must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influences on past, current, and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding controls on emission of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide. Resolution of such policy issues requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical processes.",Climate Forcing by Anthropogenic Aerosols

As an active layer, a Zn-doped InGaN layer was used for the DH LEDs. The typical output power was 1500 ÎźW and the external quantum efficiency was as high as 2.7% at a forward current of 20 mA at room temperature. The peak wavelength and the full width at half-maximum of the electroluminescence were 450 and 70 nm, respectively.

902,"HERWIG is a general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator, which includes the simulation of hard lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron scattering and soft hadron-hadron collisions in one package. It uses the parton-shower approach for initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects and azimuthal correlations both within and between jets. This article updates the description of HERWIG published in 1992, emphasising the new features incorporated since then. These include, in particular, the matching of first-order matrix elements with parton showers, a more correct treatment of heavy quark decays, and a wide range of new processes, including many predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, with the option of R-parity violation. At the same time we offer a brief review of the physics underlying HERWIG, together with details of the input and control parameters and the output data, to provide a self-contained guide for prospective users of the program.",HERWIG 6: an event generator for hadron emission reactions with interfering gluons (including supersymmetric processes)
903,"Topological insulators are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by the spin-orbit interaction that are different from conventional insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z<SUB>2</SUB> topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z<SUB>2</SUB> invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z<SUB>2</SUB> invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z<SUB>2</SUB> invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi<SUB>1-x</SUB>Sb<SUB>x</SUB> as well as α-Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain.

905,"It is shown that charged particles can be accelerated to high energies in astrophysical shock fronts. Fast particles are prevented from streaming away upstream of a shock front by scattering off Alfven waves which they themselves generate. This scattering confines the particles to the region around the shock and results in first-order Fermi acceleration due to the particles crossing the shock many times. The consequent energy spectrum is a power law with an index close to that observed for galactic cosmic rays. The discussion relates to particles which are already relativistic, and their initial acceleration from thermal energies is not considered.",The acceleration of cosmic rays in shock fronts - I.

The succession of changes through each climate cycle and termination was similar, and atmospheric and climate properties oscillated between stable bounds. Interglacial periods differed in temporal evolution and duration. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane correlate well with Antarctic air-temperature throughout the record. Present-day atmospheric burdens of these two important greenhouse gases seem to have been unprecedented during the past 420,000 years.","Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica"
907,"Antiparticles account for a small fraction of cosmic rays and are known to be produced in interactions between cosmic-ray nuclei and atoms in the interstellar medium, which is referred to as a `secondary source'. Positrons might also originate in objects such as pulsars and microquasars or through dark matter annihilation, which would be `primary sources'. Previous statistically limited measurements of the ratio of positron and electron fluxes have been interpreted as evidence for a primary source for the positrons, as has an increase in the total electron+positron flux at energies between 300 and 600GeV (ref. 8). Here we report a measurement of the positron fraction in the energy range 1.5-100GeV. We find that the positron fraction increases sharply over much of that range, in a way that appears to be completely inconsistent with secondary sources. We therefore conclude that a primary source, be it an astrophysical object or dark matter annihilation, is necessary.",An anomalous positron abundance in cosmic rays with energies 1.5-100GeV

909,Correlations of linear polarizations of pairs of photons have been measured with time-varying analyzers. The analyzer in each leg of the apparatus is an acousto-optical switch followed by two linear polarizers. The switches operate at incommensurate frequencies near 50 MHz. Each analyzer amounts to a polarizer which jumps between two orientations in a time short compared with the photon transit time. The results are in good agreement with quantum mechanical predictions but violate Bell's inequalities by 5 standard deviations.,Experimental Test of Bell's Inequalities Using Time- Varying Analyzers
910,Experimental results in the published literature show that at low normal stress the shear stress required to slide one rock over another varies widely between experiments. This is because at low stress rock friction is strongly dependent on surface roughness. At high normal stress that effect is diminished and the friction is nearly independent of rock type. If the sliding surfaces are separated by gouge composed of Montmorillonite or vermiculite the friction can be very low.,Friction of rocks
911,"The leading empirical orthogonal function of the wintertime sea-level pressure field is more strongly coupled to surface air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It resembles the NAO in many respects; but its primary center of action covers more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this âArctic Oscillationâ (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K. These trends can be interpreted as the development of a systematic bias in one of the atmosphere's dominant, naturally occurring modes of variability.",The Arctic oscillation signature in the wintertime geopotential height and temperature fields

915,"After they have interacted, quantum particles generally behave as a single nonseparable entangled system. The concept of entanglement plays an essential role in quantum physics. We have performed entanglement experiments with Rydberg atoms and microwave photons in a cavity and tested quantum mechanics in situations of increasing complexity. Entanglement resulted either from a resonant exchange of energy between atoms and the cavity field or from dispersive energy shifts affecting atoms and photons when they were not resonant. With two entangled particles (two atoms or one atom and a photon), we have realized new versions of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen situation. The detection of one particle projected the other, at a distance, in a correlated state. This process could be viewed as an elementary measurement, one particle being a ``meter'' measuring the other. We have performed a ``quantum nondemolition'' measurement of a single photon, which we detected repeatedly without destroying it. Entanglement is also essential to understand decoherence, the process accounting for the classical appearance of the macroscopic world. A mesoscopic superposition of states (``Schrรถdinger cat'') gets rapidly entangled with its environment, losing its quantum coherence. We have prepared a Schrรถdinger cat made of a few photons and studied the dynamics of its decoherence, in an experiment which constitutes a glimpse at the quantum/classical boundary. We have also investigated entanglement as a resource for the processing of quantum information. By using quantum two-state systems (qubits) instead of classical bits of information, one can perform logical operations exploiting quantum interferences and taking advantage of the properties of entanglement. Manipulating as qubits atoms and photons in a cavity, we have operated a quantum gate and applied it to the generation of a complex three-particle entangled state. We finally discuss the perspectives opened by these experiments for further fundamental studies.",Manipulating quantum entanglement with atoms and photons in a cavity

Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input-output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.",Phase retrieval algorithms: a comparison

919,"The one-dimensional molecular-crystal model of polaron motion, described in the preceding paper, is here analyzed for the case in which the electronic-overlap term of the total Hamiltonian is a small perturbation. In zeroth order —i.e., in the absence of this term—the electron is localized at a given site, p. The vibrational state of the system is specified by a set of quantum-numbers, N<SUB>k</SUB>, giving the degree of excitation of each vibration-mode; the latter differ from the conventional modes in that in each of them, the equilibrium displacement, about which the system oscillates, depends upon the location of the electron. The presence of a nonvanishing electronic-overlap term gives rise to transitions in which the electron jumps to a neighboring site ( p → p ± 1), and in which either all of the N<SUB>k</SUB> remain unaltered (""diagonal"" transitions) or in which some of them change by ±1 (""nondiagonal"" transitions). The two types of transitions play fundamentally different roles. At sufficiently low temperatures, the diagonal transitions are dominant. They give rise to the formation of Bloch-type bands whose widths (see Eq. 37) are each given by the product of the electronic-overlap integral, and a vibrational overlap-integral, the latter being an exponentially falling function of the N<SUB>k</SUB> (and, hence, of temperature). In this low-temperature domain, the role of the nondiagonal transitions is essentially one of scattering. In the absence of other scattering mechanisms, such as impurity scattering, they determine the lifetimes of the polaron-band states and, hence, the mean free path for typical transport quantities, such as electron diffusivity. With rising temperature, the probability of the off-diagonal transitions goes up exponentially. This feature, together with the above-mentioned drop in bandwidth, results, e.g., in an exponentially diminishing diffusivity. Eventually, a temperature, T <SUB>t</SUB> ̃ 1/2 the Debye θ, is reached at which the energy uncertainty, h̷/gt, associated with the finite lifetime of the states, is equal to the bandwidth. At this point, the Bloch states lose their individual characteristics (in particular, those which depend upon electronic wave number); the bands may then be considered as ""washed out"". For temperatures 〉 T<SUB>t</SUB>, electron motion is predominantly a diffusion process. The elementary steps of this process consist of the random-jumps between neighboring sites associated with the nondiagonal transitions. In conformance with this picture, the electron diffusivity is, apart from a numerical factor, the product of the square of the lattice distance and the total non-diagonal transition probability, and is therefore an exponentially rising function of temperature. The limit, J<SUB>max</SUB>, of the magnitude of the electronic overlap term, beyond which the perturbation treatment of the present paper becomes inapplicable, is investigated. For representative values of the parameters entering into the theory, J<SUB>max</SUB> ̃ 0.12 ev and 0.035 ev for the extreme cases of (a) width of the ground-state polaron-band and (b) high-temperature site-jump probabilities (these numbers correspond to electronic bandwidths of 0.24 ev and 0.07 ev, respectively). For electronic bandwidths in excess of these limits, a treatment based on the adiabatic approach is required; preliminary results of such a treatment are given for the above two cases.","Studies of polaron motion : Part II.

Skyrme's interaction is described and the general formula for the mean energy of a spherical nucleus derived. Hartree-Fock equations are obtained by varying the mean energy with respect to the single-particle wave functions of occupied states. Relations between the parameters of the Skyrme force and various general properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are analyzed. Calculations have been made for closed-shell nuclei using two rather different sets of parameters, both of which give good binding energies and radii for <SUP>16</SUP>O and <SUP>208</SUP>Pb. Both interactions give good binding energies and charge radii for all closed-shell nuclei. Calculated electron scattering angular distributions agree qualitatively with experiment, and for one interaction there is good quantitative agreement. The single-particle energies calculated with the two interactions are somewhat different owing to a different nonlocality of the Hartree-Fock potentials, but both interactions give the correct order and density of single-particle levels near the Fermi level.

931,"Electrical current can be completely spin polarized in a class of materials known as half-metals, as a result of the coexistence of metallic nature for electrons with one spin orientation and insulating nature for electrons with the other. Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been predicted for some ferromagnetic metals-for example, the Heusler compounds-and were first observed in a manganese perovskite. In view of the potential for use of this property in realizing spin-based electronics, substantial efforts have been made to search for half-metallic materials. However, organic materials have hardly been investigated in this context even though carbon-based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic devices. Here we predict half-metallicity in nanometre-scale graphene ribbons by using first-principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable if in-plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic properties can be controlled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of scientific interest in the interplay between electric fields and electronic spin degree of freedom in solids but may also open a new path to explore spintronics at the nanometre scale, based on graphene.",Half-metallic graphene nanoribbons
932,"A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.",The theory of a general quantum system interacting with a linear dissipative system

Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation of quantum communication. However, owing to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. Here we describe a scheme that allows the implementation of robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and is therefore compatible with current experimental technology.

In order to provide a basis for comparison, as well as to see if a simpler scheme will suffice, we also calculate the spectrum of the same alloy using the average t-matrix approximation introduced by Beeby. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the average t-matrix approximation is not adequate for the description of an actual transition-metal alloy, while the coherent-potential picture will provide a more reasonable facsimile of the density of states in such an alloy.",Coherent-Potential Model of Substitutional Disordered Alloys

945,"The representation of Fermi particles by two-component Pauli spinors satisfying a second order differential equation and the suggestion that in β decay these spinors act without gradient couplings leads to an essentially unique weak four-fermion coupling. It is equivalent to equal amounts of vector and axial vector coupling with two-component neutrinos and conservation of leptons. (The relative sign is not determined theoretically.) It is taken to be ""universal"" the lifetime of the μ agrees to within the experimental errors of 2%. The vector part of the coupling is, by analogy with electric charge, assumed to be not renormalized by virtual mesons. This requires, for example, that pions are also ""charged"" in the sense that there is a direct interaction in which, say, a π<SUP>0</SUP> goes to π<SUP>-</SUP> and an electron goes to a neutrino.

948,"This paper presents a new event generator, ALPGEN, dedicated to the study of multiparton hard processes in hadronic collisions. The code performs, at the leading order in QCD and EW interactions, the calculation of the exact matrix elements for a large set of parton-level processes of interest in the study of the Tevatron and LHC data. The current version of the code describes the following final states: (W rightarrow f fbar') Q Qbar + N jets (Q being a heavy quark, and f=l,q), with N 〈 = 4; (Z/gamma*rightarrow f fbar), Q Qbar + N jets (f=l,nu), with N 〈 = 4; (W rightarrow f fbar') + charm + N jets (f=l,q, N 〈 = 5); (W rightarrow f fbar') + N jets (f=l,q) and (Z/gamma*rightarrow f fbar) + N jets (f=l,nu), with N 〈 = 6; nW + mZ+ lH + N jets, with n + m + l + N 〈 = 8, N 〈 = 3, including all 2-fermion decay modes of W and Z bosons, with spin correlations; Q Qbar + N jets, with t rightarrow b f fbar' decays and relative spin correlations included if Q=t, and N 〈 = 6; Q Qbar Q' Qbar'+ N jets, with Q and Q' heavy quarks (possibly equal) and N 〈 = 4; H Q Qbar + N jets, with t rightarrow b f fbar' decays and relative spin correlations included if Q=t and N 〈 = 4; N jets, with N 〈 = 6. Parton-level events are generated, providing full information on their colour and flavour structure, enabling the evolution of the partons into fully hadronised final states.","ALPGEN, a generator for hard multiparton processes in hadronic collisions"

950,"New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σ<SUB>init</SUB>) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that σ<SUB>init</SUB>≈ 10 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>near Jupiter's orbit and that σ<SUB>init</SUB>∝a<SUP>-2</SUP>, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the ""minimum-mass"" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.",Formation of the Giant Planets by Concurrent Accretion of Solids and Gas

With five years of polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization, τ〉0, at 5σ significance. The redshift of an instantaneous reionization is constrained to be z <SUB>reion</SUB> = 11.0 ± 1.4 with 68% confidence. The 2σ lower limit is z <SUB>reion</SUB> 〉 8.2, and the 3σ limit is z <SUB>reion</SUB> 〉 6.7. This excludes a sudden reionization of the universe at z = 6 at more than 3.5σ significance, suggesting that reionization was an extended process. Using two methods for polarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the optical depth, indicating an error due to the foreground treatment of τ ~ 0.01. This cosmological model also fits small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, and a range of astronomical data measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe.

959,"This is a review of the statistical properties of the scattering matrix of a mesoscopic system. Two geometries are contrasted: A quantum dot and a disordered wire. The quantum dot is a confined region with a chaotic classical dynamics, which is coupled to two electron reservoirs via point contacts. The disordered wire also connects two reservoirs, either directly or via a point contact or tunnel barrier. One of the two reservoirs may be in the superconducting state, in which case conduction involves Andreev reflection at the interface with the superconductor. In the case of the quantum dot, the distribution of the scattering matrix is given by either Dyson's circular ensemble for ballistic point contacts or the Poisson kernel for point contacts containing a tunnel barrier. In the case of the disordered wire, the distribution of the scattering matrix is obtained from the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar equation, which is a one-dimensional scaling equation. The equivalence is discussed with the nonlinear Ď model, which is a supersymmetric field theory of localization. The distribution of scattering matrices is applied to a variety of physical phenomena, including universal conductance fluctuations, weak localization, Coulomb blockade, sub-Poissonian shot noise, reflectionless tunneling into a superconductor, and giant conductance oscillations in a Josephson junction.",Random-matrix theory of quantum transport
960,"We develop analytic methods for studying the formation of galaxies by gas condensation within massive dark halos. Our scheme applies to cosmogonies where structure grows through hierarchical clustering of a mixture of gas and dissipationless dark matter. It is an elaboration of the ideas of White & Rees. We adopt the simplest models consistent with our current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling. We also employ standard models for the evolution of stellar populations, and construct new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas. Although our approach is phenomenological, we avoid assumptions which have no clear physical basis. Our methods allow us to predict star formation as a function of location and time, and so the following properties of the galaxy population: current star formation rates and halo X-ray luminosities; current luminosity functions both for galaxies and for virialized systems; relations between present luminosity, circular velocity, metallicity, and stellar or total M/L ratio; the history of the OB star contribution to the metagalactic ionizing flux; and the distribution of faint blue (star-forming) galaxies in both apparent magnitude and redshift. In this paper we give detailed results only for a cold dark matter universe with {OMEGA}=1 and H_0_=50 km s^-1^ Mpc^-1^, although our methods are easily applied to other models. Even for this case, predictions depend strongly on the mean baryon density, on the fluctuation amplitude, on the models for heating and metal enrichment by massive stars, and on the initial mass function with which stars form. Our most successful models require a large baryon fraction ({OMEGA}_b_/{OMEGA} ~ă 0.1) and efficient heating and enrichment of halo gas. They then approximately reproduce the characteristic luminosities of galaxies and of galaxy clusters, the observed relations between galaxy properties and the kind of bias needed to reconcile {OMEGA} = 1 with the observed kinematics of galaxy clustering. However, the amplitude of this bias is too small, and additional sources of bias must be invoked. Our luminosity functions contain significantly more faint galaxies than are observed. This is a serious discrepancy which may be alleviated by starbursts in dwarf galaxies, by selective merging of such systems, and by observational selection against low surface brightness dwarfs. Successful models form their stars late, typically more than half of them since z = 1, making the epoch of galaxy formation easily accessible to observation.",Galaxy Formation through Hierarchical Clustering
961,"How localized electrons interact with delocalized electrons is a central question to many problems in sold-state physics. The simplest manifestation of this situation is the Kondo effect, which occurs when an impurity atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a metal. At low temperatures a spin singlet state is formed between the unpaired localized electron and delocalized electrons at the Fermi energy. Theories predict that a Kondo singlet should form in a single-electron transistor (SET), which contains a confined `droplet' of electrons coupled by quantum-mechanical tunnelling to the delocalized electrons in the transistor's leads. If this is so, a SET could provide a means of investigating aspects of the Kondo effect under controlled circumstances that are not accessible in conventional systems: the number of electrons can be changed from odd to even, the difference in energy between the localized state and the Fermi level can be tuned, the coupling to the leads can be adjusted, voltage differences can be applied to reveal non-equilibrium Kondo phenomena, and a single localized state can be studied rather than a statistical distribution. But for SETs fabricated previously, the binding energy of the spin singlet has been too small to observe Kondo phenomena. Ralph and Buhrman have observed the Kondo singlet at a single accidental impurity in a metal point contact, but with only two electrodes and without control over the structure they were not able to observe all of the features predicted. Here we report measurements on SETs smaller than those made previously, which exhibit all of the predicted aspects of the Kondo effect in such a system.",Kondo effect in a single-electron transistor

967,"Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z ă 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ~ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ~ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.",Breaking the hierarchy of galaxy formation
968,"The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance R. This factor is equal to unity for R small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to R<SUP>-1</SUP> for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by -3ℏcα8πR<SUP>4</SUP>, where α is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to R<SUP>-1</SUP> for large distances.

Their thermal conductivity and mechanical stiffness may rival the remarkable in-plane values for graphite (~3,000Wm<SUP>-1</SUP>K<SUP>-1</SUP> and 1,060GPa, respectively); their fracture strength should be comparable to that of carbon nanotubes for similar types of defects; and recent studies have shown that individual graphene sheets have extraordinary electronic transport properties. One possible route to harnessing these properties for applications would be to incorporate graphene sheets in a composite material. The manufacturing of such composites requires not only that graphene sheets be produced on a sufficient scale but that they also be incorporated, and homogeneously distributed, into various matrices. Graphite, inexpensive and available in large quantity, unfortunately does not readily exfoliate to yield individual graphene sheets.

978,"This paper describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the data taken thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au + Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing Au + Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of participants at higher p ( Ě4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse momentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and elliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of pseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei, a property we describe as ""extended longitudinal scaling"". Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were found to factorize to a surprising degree.",The PHOBOS perspective on discoveries at RHIC

We assume that two terms in the energy density break SU<SUB>3</SUB>×SU<SUB>3</SUB> symmetry; under SU<SUB>3</SUB> one transforms as a singlet, the other as the member of an octet. The simplest possible behavior of these terms under chiral transformations is proposed: They are assigned to a single (3,3<SUP>*</SUP>)+(3<SUP>*</SUP>,3) representation of SU<SUB>3</SUB>×SU<SUB>3</SUB> and parity together with the current divergences. The commutators of charges and current divergences are derived in terms of a single constant c that describes the strength of the SU<SUB>3</SUB>-breaking term relative to the chiral symmetry-breaking term. The constant c is found not to be small, as suggested earlier, but instead close to the value (-2) corresponding to an SU<SUB>2</SUB>×SU<SUB>2</SUB> symmetry, realized mainly by massless pions rather than parity doubling. Some applications of the proposed commutation relations are given, mainly to the pseudoscalar mesons, and other applications are indicated.",Behavior of Current Divergences under SU<SUB>3</SUB>×SU<SUB>3</SUB>
983,"The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than b<SUB>J</SUB>=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80°×15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75°×10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000deg<SUP>2</SUP> and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000Å at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0Å and a median S/N of 13pixel<SUP>-1</SUP>. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q〉=3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. The overall redshift completeness for Q〉=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

984,"The formation of dwarf, diffuse, metal-poor galaxies as a result of supernova-driven winds is reexamined in view of the accumulating data on the systematic properties of dwarfs in the Local Group and in the Virgo Cluster. The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the ""cold"" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).","The Origin of Dwarf Galaxies, Cold Dark Matter, and Biased Galaxy Formation"

988,"A detailed review of progress in understanding the last stages of evolution of low and intermediate mass stars is presented. The thermal pulse phase of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution is addressed first, and estimates and implications of noncatastrophic mass loss and ejection from AGB stars are reviewed. The concept of synthetic AGB evolution is presented and the algorithms that follow from this concept are used to review estimates of the ages of stellar aggregates that contain AGB stars. Evolution to the white dwarf state as well as the nature of type I 1/2 supernovae are discussed. Theoretical predictions are compared with observations, emphasizing predictions about the surface abundances given by 'canonical' stellar evolution versus abundances estimated from spectroscopic observations.",Asymptotic giant branch evolution and beyond.
989,"Expressions are derived for the mass of a stationary axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations containing a black hole surrounded by matter and for the difference in mass between two neighboring such solutions. Two of the quantities which appear in these expressions, namely the area A of the event horizon and the “surface gravity” κ of the black hole, have a close analogy with entropy and temperature respectively. This analogy suggests the formulation of four laws of black hole mechanics which correspond to and in some ways transcend the four laws of thermodynamics.",The four laws of black hole mechanics

I show that if β<SUP>2</SUP> exceeds 8π, the energy density of the theory is unbounded below; if β<SUP>2</SUP> equals 4π, the theory is equivalent to the zero-charge sector of the theory of a free massive Fermi field; for other values of β, the theory is equivalent to the zero-charge sector of the massive Thirring model.

993,"It is assumed that the rate of star formation for population I varies with a power n of the density of interstellar gas and that the initial luminosity function is time-independent. Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.",The Rate of Star Formation.
994,"We consider general-relativistic, spatially homogeneous, and isotropic k = 0 cosmological models with either pressure zero or pressure one-third the energy density. The equations for general linearized perturbations away from these models are explicitly integrated to obtain density fluctuations, rotational perturbations, and gravitational waves. The equations for light rays in the perturbed models are integrated. The models are used to estimate the anisotropy of the microwave radiation, assuming this radiation is cosmological It is estimated that density fluctuations now of order 10 per cent with characteristic lengths now of order 1000 Mpc would cause anisotropies of order 1 per cent in the observed microwave temperature due to the gravitational red shift and other general-relativistic effects. The p = 0 models are compared in detail with corresponding Newtonian models The perturbed Newtonian models do not contain gravitational waves, but the density perturbations and rotational perturbations are surprisingly similar.",Perturbations of a Cosmological Model and Angular Variations of the Microwave Background
995,"The current understanding is summarized from a unified point of view, which Bethe initiated four decades ago and which enables one to put a variety of theoretical and experimental data into a coherent picture. Properties of the generalized oscillator strength, which plays the central role in the theory, are treated in detail. The integrated cross section for inelastic scattering and related quantities at the high-velocity limit also are discussed. The theory provides a series of criteria for testing the compatibility of cross-section data and atomic (or molecular) properties that may be obtained from theory or independent experiments.",Inelastic Collisions of Fast Charged Particles with Atoms and Molecules-The Bethe Theory Revisited

997,"When a conducting layer is placed in a strong perpendicular magnetic field, there exist current-carrying electron states which are localized within approximately a cyclotron radius of the sample boundary but are extended around the perimeter of the sample. It is shown that these quasi-one-dimensional states remain extended and carry a current even in the presence of a moderate amount of disorder. The role of the edge states in the quantized Hall conductance is discussed in the context of the general explanation of Laughlin. An extension of Laughlin's analysis is also used to investigate the existence of extended states in a weakly disordered two-dimensional system, when a strong magnetic field is present.","Quantized Hall conductance, current-carrying edge states, and the existence of extended states in a two-dimensional disordered potential"
