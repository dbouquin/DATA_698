    "The below sections outline the results of an analysis initially geared toward testing the following hyptheses:\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Some subdomains of astronomy will be more acurately generated by the LSTM ANN than others. The relationship will be correlated with the diversity of unique words used within the training corpus of text representing the subdomain. This is to say that a subdomain with a larger variety of unique words (combinations of letters) will be more challenging to for the LSTM ANN to generate than a training corpus with fewer unique words. I hypothesize that more data will be needed to achieve a high degree of similarity between generated text and training text in some fields than others and that this will similarly correspond to unique word count. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The ability to generate a similar title to those available to train the model in the original training sets will be different between fields that are more emergent compared with those that are more established. For instance, I hypothesize that the LSTM ANN will be more effective in generating titles based on the \"black hole\" data than on the \"exoplanet\" data as the exoplanet field is much less established and therefore likely less regular from a linguistics perspective than text discussing black holes.\n",
