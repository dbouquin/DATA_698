    "### Introduction   \n",
    "In 1987, a very simple definition of an \"artificial neural network\" (ANN) was presented by Maureen Caudill, an expert on artificial intellegence. Caudill wrote that an artifical neural network is \"...a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs\" [1]. With this definition in mind, what I propose herein is a small study on the application of a particular type of recurant ANN, long short-term memory (LSTM), to generate domain-specific text in various subdisciplines of astronomy and astrophysics (research on black holes, astrobiology, and exoplanets). Subsequent to the training and sampling of astronomy and astrophysics related text, I will apply measures including term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and cosine similarity, along with a vector space model to assess the degree to which the text generated by the ANN accurately reflects the text used to train the system. I will also use the proportion of non-ASCII characters generated by the LSTM models as an indicator of the success of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conducting this study I will be applying the aforementioned approaches to a dataset that has not yet been used to test the capacity for this type of system to \"learn\": metadata from the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System. I will also be applying an LSTM ANN to in a jargon-heavy scientific domain, which is an area of limited research. Moreover, this analysis stands to help foster conversations within the library science community about the challenges non-scientists face in improving their scientific literacy and engaging with academic publications. Specifically, the ANN-generated \"fake\" astronomy text could potentially be used as control text in future literacy studies and the degree of success achieved in emulating the text could serve as an indicator of the complexity inherent to this kind of discipline-specific language. Moreover, the domains within astronomy and astrophysics that I choose to compare to one another will reepresent fields with differing longevity and I will therefore be able to make inferences as to how the age of the field may impact the model's ability to emulate the text. Furthermore, sharing the ANN-generated \"fake\" astronomy text with the astronomy community and others will allow us to further frame conversations about \"fake news\" and scientific literacy."

    "### Data Source\n",
    "The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) [2], is an online database of over eight million astronomy and physics papers from both peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed sources. The ADS is a highly used resource in the astronomy and astrophysics communities and has many levels of indexing. The ADS API makes it possible to query this valuable resource to better understand authorship and publishing behavior in these fields among many other applications. The ADS allows for full-text searching, and in the near future, will be fully incorporating [Unified Astronomy Thesaurus](http://astrothesaurus.org/) keywords into their indexing schema. The ADS is managed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the Harvardâ€“Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics with funding from NASA."

    "### Background   \n",
    "Artificial neural networks can be understood as being organized into \"layers\" with layers being made up of a number of interconnected \"nodes\" which each contain an \"activation function\". Data are passed into the \"input layer\" of the system, which communicates to \"hidden layers\" where the actual processing is done via a system of weighted \"connections\". Subsequently, the hidden layers connect with an \"output layer\" where the answer is output [3]. Since the creation of ANNs, these layered connections of nodes have been implementated in many different ways. Each implementation has been designed to meet different needs and experiments. Perhaps the most recognizable application of ANNs in popular culture is Google's \"Deep Dream\", a computer vision program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In text-based applications of ANNs though, recurant neural networks have become favored over convolutional systems. For instance, Twitter bots like \"Deep Drumpf\" [5] have been used to demonstrate the powerful effectiveness of recurrant ANNs by emulating the linguistical style and syntax of individual people. Similarly, people have used recurrant ANNs to generate text based on the plays of Shakespeare [6], the essays of Paul Graham [7] and even to generate baby names [8]. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla Motors' leader on artifical intelligence reserach, has stated that some of the reasoning behind the \"unreasonable effectiveness of recurrant neural networks\" is that with convolutional systems, \"their API is too constrained\" in that they accept only a fixed-sized vector as input and subsequently produce a fixed-sized vector as output using a fixed amount of computational steps. Unlike these convolutional ANNs, recurant ANNs allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: sequences in the input, output, or even both [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "To further define and justify the approach to be used for the herein described experiment, it is necessary to define the specific recurant ANN I will be employing: long short-term memory (LTSM). LTSM ANNs are \"capable of learning long-term dependencies\" [10] and do not start from scratch whenever they are presented with new data. LTSMs were introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 [11] and were refined iteratively following their work. The LTSM approach to recurant ANNs is ideal for the type of text-based analysis I will be conducting because by using LTSM you can train the system on a large corpus of text and it will \"learn\" to generate text like it one character at a time. This, along with LTSM's relative insensitivity to \"gap length\" gives an advantage to LSTM over alternative recurant neural networks [12]. Note, I have not found any evidence so far showing this approach being applied to text from astrophysics articles or using language from such a scientific-jargon heavy field.\n",

    "### Test Cases\n",
    "In order to test out the capability of a LSTM recurant ANN to work effectively with astronomy-related text, I will subset increasingly large datasets from the metadata available through the Astrophysics Data System. I will use the titles to train the herein described ANN and to generate test titles. I will do this for different subdisciplines within the field. I will gather baseline metrics for each training dataset that I will be able to use to compare differences between \"real\" training data and \"fake\" data generated from the LSTM models. The metrics I will gather are as follows:\n",
    "* Total number of unique words in various sizes of training sets within a domain\n",
    "* Average proportion of non-ASCII characters in various sizes of training sets within a domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-ASCII characters are characters that do not fall within the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) [13]) character encoding scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sets\n",
    "I have chosen to extract from the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System metadata from three different domains within astronomy and astrophysics. The datasets I have built to train the LSTM artificial neural network are available for download [here](https://github.com/dbouquin/DATA_698/tree/master/Training_Datasets) and are made up of increasingly large lists of titles from three specific domains. The lists range in length from the most recently published 1,000 titles of papers written in their prospective fields, up to the most recent 35,000 papers indexed by ADS. It is important to note here though that due to limitations in processing capability I have only yet performed baseline analyses for training datasets up to 20,000 titles and may not reach a capacity to process 35,000 titles.\n",
    "The three domains within astronomy and astrophysics that I chose to analyse are:\n",
    "* Black Holes - [earliest publication available in ADS is 1799](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1799AllGE...4....1L/abstract)\n",
    "* Astrobiology - [earliest publication available in ADS is 1870](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1870Natur...3...86M/abstract)\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "My hypthothesis is that some fields will be more acurately generated by the LSTM ANN than others. The relationship will be correlated with the diversity of unique words used within the training corpus of text representing the subdomain. This is to say that a subdomain with a larger variety of unique words (combinations of letters) will be more challenging to for the LSTM ANN to generate than a training corpus with fewer unique words. I hypothesize that more data will be needed to achieve a high degree of similarity between generated text and training text in some fields than others and that this will similarly correspond to unique word count. I also hypothesize that the ability to generate a similar title to those available to train the model in the original training sets will be different between fields that are more emergent compared with those that are more established. For instance, I hypothesize that the LSTM ANN will be more effective in generating titles based on the \"black hole\" data than on the \"exoplanet\" data as the exoplanet field is much less established and therefore likely less regular from a linguistics perspective than text discussing black holes."

Standard instructions for installing Torch on various operating systems are available [here](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn) [20]. I do not have access to GPU resources locally and followed Torch's standard [OSX installation instructions](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2016/03/25/torch-rnn-mac-install/) [21]. Unfortunately this means that the amount of time that it takes to train my LSTM models is extensive and serves as a limitation to this study. With more time and resources it would be possible to expand this analysis into the cloud to speed the compuation along, however, it is still possible to run the herein described tests without cloud computing."

This analysis was done using sample text from an LSTM model trained on 1,000 real black hole titles. To supplement this analysis I have demonstrated [here](https://github.com/dbouquin/DATA_698/blob/master/analysis/ascii_analysis/ascii_exoplanets_vis.ipynb) [26] how the proportion of non-ASCII characters gets increasingly realistic as the training size of the data increases.

    "### Limitations\n",
    "The process that I have defined here of sampling data from the Astrophysics Data System, processing it for use in training an LSTM ANN model using Torch, generating sample titles from the trained model, and subsequently analyzing the results, can be used to test the hypothesis I have layed out for this project. The limitations of this approach are not inherent to the process, but instead are linked to the capabilities of the hardware I am employing to train the neural network and the bandwidth throttling of the Astrophysics Data System API, which times out at attempts to pull datasets greater than 35,000 article records. My personal computer has proved incapable of running processes to train models using datasets greater than 20,000 titles. LSTM neural networks are inherently slow to train despite their effectiveness.\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "The next steps for this project are to execute the above workflow at a larger scale. I will compare the above results to the results of the same analyses using training sets from three different domains within astronomy with increasingly large datasets to train my models (1K, 5K, 10K, and 20K titles). I will then be able to make generalizations about how the LSTM does in emulating text from three fields and infer ideas about how the fields differ."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "The above described analysis can be effective in examining the complexity inherent in different subfields of astronomy and astrophysics. Once scaled to include analyses of text generated using larger training datasets from other subfields, I will be able to test my hypotheses by making analytical and visual comparisons between the fields in question. The LSTM ANN approach does work as desired, however, training time is slow and would be more practical with additional computing resources. Future analysis using cloud infrastructure may be explored as a addendum to this project."
